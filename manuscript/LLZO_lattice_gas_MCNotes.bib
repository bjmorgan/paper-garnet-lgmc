@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The average hop rate per atom is the inverse of the mean residence time, ${\mathaccent "0365\relax {\nu }}=1/{\mathaccent "0365\relax \tau }$. The contribution from each atom is a sum over individual hop rates, $\Gamma _i$, and is therefore related to the ``total rate'' of the kMC method via ${\mathaccent "0365\relax {\nu }}=\left <Q\right >/N$.\cite {Mehrer_DiffusionBook}"}

@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="Because the lattice-gas model used here considers hops as barrierless, where hopping probabilities only depend on energy differences between intial and final states, the effective transport coefficients calculated here cannot be directly compared to experimental values. Introducing fixed barrier heights for tet$\leftrightarrow $oct hops is equivalent to scaling the hopping prefactor ${\mathaccent "0365\relax {\nu }}$, which preserves \protect \emph  {relative} differences in the transport coefficients presented here. A more realistic model would need to account for the influence of local site occupations on individual hopping barriers, see e.g.\ Ref.\ \cite {VanderVenAndCeder_HandbookofMaterialsModelling2010}, and would give quantitative deviations from the trends presented here."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="Kozinsky \protect \emph  {et al.} have also proposed a fully ordered phase at $x_\protect \mathrm  {Li}=6$, from a combined first-principles calculations and group theory analysis \cite {KozinskyEtAl_PhysRevLett2016}. Their proposed ground state differs from the pure octahedral occupation predicted here, and consists of mixed octahedral and tetrahedral occupation. "}
