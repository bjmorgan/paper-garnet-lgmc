	Annote = {(This study of MnO2) is an example of Li diffusion barriers being very different (much higher in this case) at electrolyte surfaces compared to bulk values. 

How is this explained as being related to the electrostatic potential (Madelung potential?) and would this relationship be expected to hold away from the dilute limit? (Possible screening by other Li ions / equilibration of ion distributions with respect to electrochemical potential). 

To what extent is diffusion effectively 1-dimensional? If so we would expect possible blocking / concerted diffusion processes at higher Li content?

Does the Li content within neighbouring c channels affect the diffusion of ions? Possibly by modifying the local electrostatic potential? (Related to this will be the question of the electron distribution at different Li contents). 

In nanocrystalline beta-MnO2 where does Li prefer to sit, where do excess electrons prefer to sit (subsurface in rutile TiO2, I think - see Selloni papers) and how do these behaviours interact. It is possible to envisage e.g. Li intercalation that then traps electrons at the surface, which modifies diffusion barriers for subsequent Li intercalation. This could be looked at using e.g. ONETEP?},

We find that LiCoO2 has a complex defect chemistry; different electronic and ionic defects can exist under different synthesis conditions{,} and LiCoO2 samples free of cobalt antisite defects can be made under Li-excess (Co-deficient) environments. A defect model for lithium over-stoichiometric LiCoO2 is also proposed{,} which involves negatively charged lithium antisites and positively charged small (hole) polarons. In LiNiO2{,} a certain amount of Ni3+ ions undergo charge disproportionation and the concentration of nickel ions in the lithium layers is high. Tuning the synthesis conditions may reduce the nickel antisites but would not remove the charge disproportionation. In addition{,} we find that LiMO2 cannot be doped n- or p-type; the electronic conduction occurs via hopping of small polarons and the ionic conduction occurs via migration of lithium vacancies{,} either through a monovacancy or divacancy mechanism{,} depending on the vacancy concentration.},

	Abstract = {In this work we report the synthesis and the characterization of black anatase TiO2. We show that this material displays a nanostructured architecture{,} with an electro-conducting trivalent Ti. The presence of trivalent Ti in this structure narrows the inherent high band gap energy to a semiconductor level{,} reaching a value as low as 1.8 eV{,} resulting in the very high electrical conductivity of 8 [times] 10-2 S cm-1. These extraordinary electro-conducting physical properties ensure an ultra fast Li+ insertion into and extraction from the host structure of anatase TiO2 making it a unique{,} high rate electrode{,} delivering at a 100 C-rate (20 A g-1) a discharge capacity of 127 mA h (g-TiO2)-1 with approximately 86% retention during 100 charge-discharge cycles at 25 [degree]C and approximately 84% retention at -20 [degree]C.},

	Abstract = {The anomolous DC ionic conductivity of silver chloride at high temperatures is analyzed quantitatively with the aid of mean field models and classical Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that the conductivity anomaly in silver chloride along with the exponential increase of the dielectric constant at high temperatures may be explained by referring to the idea of a ``soft lattice'', wherein silver ions are increasingly free to move about their regular lattice sites as the temperature rises. This wide ranging of silver ions leads to the formation of transient dipoles, which have the dual effect of increasing the dielectric constant and decreasing the free energy of the lattice.},

@article{Catlow_SolidStateIonics1983,
	Annote = {Seems to discuss only two classes of solid state ionic conductors; those where particle transport obeys a hopping description, and those with "liquid-like" properties.

Our hypothesis (from observations of β and γ AgI) is that for tetrahedrally coordinated structures the hopping model is misleading, since isolated "hops" never occur. Instead particle transport only takes place as a component of the concerted near-simultaneous motion of multiple ions (what do we mean by near-simultaneous? Is this only that the time scale between related diffusion events is much shorter than that between unrelated events?)

For a vacancy hopping mechanism, the hopping particles will always be spatially and temporally correlated, since a subsequent diffusion event can only occur with an ion moving into the vacancy vacated during a previous event. The distribution of times between diffusion events appears as it should still follow the Poisson distribution however? i.e. a hop having taken place makes it no more likely that the next hop happens earlier or later. This must be the case since the first hop merely translates the system, so the start and end points of a single ion diffusing are the same by symmetry.},

	Abstract = {Powder neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to investigate the structural behaviour of silver sulfide, Ag2S, at elevated temperatures. Above similar to450 K Ag2S adopts the phase in which the S2- possess a body-centred cubic arrangement. Analysis of the neutron diffraction is in good agreement with the previously proposed structural model in which the Ag+ predominantly reside within the tetrahedral interstices. At similar to865 K Ag2S transforms to the a phase in which the anion sublattice adopts a face-centred cubic arrangement. Structural refinements of this phase indicate that the cations are distributed predominantly in the tetrahedral cavities but with a significant fraction in the octahedral holes. MD simulations, using established potentials for this compound, confirm the stability of the two high-temperature superionic phases and show good agreement with the measured Ag+ distribution within the unit cell.},

	Abstract = {The ionic diffusion mechanism of mobile ions within an underlying bodycentred cubic ( bcc) sublattice of immobile counterions is discussed. In particular, the case of equal numbers of two ionic species forming long- range ordered and disordered bcc arrays is considered, since these form the basis of the cubic perovskite and alpha- AgI- type crystal structures, respectively. Their structural behaviour, and its influence on the dynamic ionic disorder which characterizes superionic conduction, is illustrated for the case of Ag+ diffusion within the beta and alpha* phases of Ag3SI. The calculated behaviour obtained by molecular dynamics ( MD) computer simulations is validated with reference to published neutron diffraction and ionic conductivity measurements of Ag3SI, and used to examine the preferred diffusion pathways. The relevance of these findings for the anion conduction mechanisms within perovskite structured compounds is briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {Silver and copper halides generally display an abrupt (first-order) transition to the superionic state. However, powder diffraction studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AgI under hydrostatic pressure both indicate that a continuous superionic transition occurs on heating. The gradual onset of the highly conducting state is accompanied by an increasing fraction of dynamic Frenkel defects, a peak in the specific heat and anomalous behavior of the lattice expansion. Similar methods have been employed to investigate the proposed continuous superionic transition between the two ambient pressure face centered cubic phases of CuI. This is difficult to examine experimentally, because the hexagonal beta phase exists over a narrow temperature range between the gamma (cation ordered) and alpha (cation disordered) phases. MD simulations performed with the simulation box constrained to remain cubic at all temperatures show that, although limited Cu+ Frenkel disorder occurs within gamma-CuI, CuI undergoes an abrupt superionic transition at 670 K to the superionic alpha phase. This is supported by powder neutron diffraction studies of CuI lightly doped with Cs+ to prevent stabilization of the beta phase. The implications of these results on the phase transitions of other copper and silver halide superionic conductors are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A 7H polytype of AgI (characterised by stacking fault arrangement) is detected at the interface of beta -AgI and gamma -Al2O3, which may even form the major (or even the only) AgI-constituent at pronounced Al2O3-contents. The driving force for the formation of the 7H phase is assumed to be the interaction of Ag+ with the basic alumina phase similar as in the AgCl and AgBr composites in which due to the relative stability of the rock salt structure only ideal semi-infinite space charge layers occur. Considering the 7H structure as a heterostructure of gamma- and beta -phase (beta/gamma/beta/gamma/...) leads to an explanation that is consistent with all the features observed: The extreme Ag+-conductivity (that can hardly be explained by semi-infinite space charges) and the peculiar phase transition behaviour on one hand, and the qualitative similarities with AgCl:Al2O3 and AgBr:Al2O3 on the other hand. Since the layer separation is in the sub-Debye length range we expect a mesoscopic effect on the ionic conductivity as predicted earlier. This is supported by conductivity anomalies in ply two phase mixtures. This mesoscopic heterolayer is discussed in the context of nano-ionics (ion conductivity in nanocrystalline materials and nano-composites) and nano-electronics (quantum wells, wires and dots).

	Abstract = {The extreme conductivity enhancement (by a factor of up to 10(4)) in AgI:Al2O3 composites as well as the anomalous phase transition to the a-phase with a large hysteresis of 50 degrees C was confirmed by conductivity, differential scanning calorimetry, and in situ X-ray diffractometry (XRD). All the composites exhibited an activation energy of 0.29 +/- 0.02 eV in conductivity which was identified with the migration enthalpy for transport in the disordered close-packed layers in AgI system. A close examination of the XRD patterns shows the existence of a seven-layer polytype (7H) for AgI with the stacking sequence ABCBCAC. This may account for anomalies in the composites in contrast to the ideal space charge effect in AgCI:Al2O3 and Ag.Br:Al2O3 composites. Since the stacking arrangement can be regarded as a heterostructure of beta-AgI (ABABAB...) and gamma-AgI (ABCABC...) with a sub-Debye length spacing, the conductivity enhancement may be attributed to the mesoscopic multiphase effect predicted earlier. The hysteresis can be attributed to the elastic effects in the martensitic transformation between alpha-AgI and 7H-AgI. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society. S0013-4651(99)09-092-8.

	Abstract = {AgI nanowires/anodic aluminum oxide ( AgI NWs/AAO) composites have been fabricated by a simple approach, which involves the thermal melting of AgI powders on the surface of the AAO membrane, followed by the infiltration of the molten AgI inside the nanochannels. As-prepared AgI nanowires have corrugated outer surfaces and are polycrystalline according to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that a considerable amount of 7H polytype AgI exists in the composites, which is supposed to arise from the interfacial interactions between the embedded AgI and the alumina. AC conductivity measurements for the AgI nanowires/AAO composites exhibit a notable conductivity enhancement by three orders of magnitude at room temperature compared with that of pristine bulk AgI. Furthermore, a large conductivity hysteresis and abnormal conductivity transitions were observed in the temperature-dependent conductivity measurements, from which an ionic conductivity as high as 8.0 x 10(2) Omega(-1) cm(-1) was obtained at around 70 degrees C upon cooling. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) result demonstrates a similar phase transition behavior as that found in the AC conductivity measurements. The enhanced ionic conductivity, as well as the abnormal phase transitions, can be explained in terms of the existence of the highly conducting 7H polytype AgI and the formation of well-defined conduction paths in the composites.},

	Abstract = {The disorder of the Ag+ ions in the superionic conductor alpha-AgI has been studied with use of computer simulations in which reorganizations of the I- lattice are inhibited. At high temperatures the ions are evenly distributed over the tetrahedral interstitial sites of the crystal but, as the temperature is lowered, the Ag+ ions are found to condense onto particular sublattices. The condensation is associated with a loss of mobility. The possible occurrence of such order-disorder transitions in this system has been suggested by Szabo [J. Phys. C 19, 3775 (1986)]. The structure of this phase was identified, using molecular-graphics methods. The Ag+ ions are found to be in a locally crystalline (monoclinic) arrangement, which is not one of the stable phases discussed by Szabo. From the geometric disposition of the ions at low temperature it is argued that the crystallites found in the simulated system would be unstable with respect to a hexagonal (wurtzite) structure if the boundary-condition-imposed stresses were to be relaxed. On this basis, it is argued that the ordering tendency of the Ag+ ions in the a phase can be seen as the driving force for the alpha-to-beta-phase transition in this material.},

	Abstract = {Basic ingredients of interfacial thermodynamics are recapitulated with a special eye on the nanometer-size regime. Questions are then briefly tackled that arise if, in heterogeneous systems, the constituent phases shrink to atomistic dimensions. Particularly helpful in this context are thermodynamic approaches, in which the introduction of interfacial tension is avoided. While the first part addresses ground structure quantities, the second part deals with questions of size and confinement effects on entropy and energy of ionic and electronic defects. These defects represent the respective excitations within this ground structure. The article emphasizes the similarities between ions and electrons manifested in the statistics rather than elaborating on the discrepancies that are primarily reflected by different densities of states and mobilities. It is, therefore, not the intention of the article to address aspects of nanoelectronics that rely on quantum transport for which many reviews are available. Nonetheless all these discussed aspects are directly relevant for both nanoionics and nanoelectronics.},

	Abstract = {Polarizable interaction potentials, parametrized using ab initio electronic structure calculations, have been used in molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of cation composition on the ionic conductivity in the Zr2Y2O7-Y3NbO7 system and to link the dynamical properties to the degree of lattice disorder. Across the composition range, this system retains a disordered fluorite crystal structure and the vacancy concentration is constant. The observed trends of decreasing conductivity and increasing disorder with increasing Nb5+ content were reproduced in simulations with the cations randomly assigned to positions on the cation sublattice. The trends were traced to the influences of the cation charges and relative sizes and their effect on vacancy ordering by carrying out additional calculations in which, for example, the charges of the cations were equalized. The simulations did not, however, reproduce all of the observed properties, particularly for Y3NbO7. Its conductivity was significantly overestimated and prominent diffuse scattering features observed in small area electron diffraction studies were not always reproduced. Consideration of these deficiencies led to a preliminary attempt to characterize the consequence of partially ordering the cations on their lattice, which significantly affects the propensity for vacancy ordering. The extent and consequences of cation ordering seem to be much less pronounced on the Zr2Y2O7 side of the composition range.},

	Abstract = {Basal-plane stacking faults in wurtzite AW, GaN, and InN are studied using density-functional-pseudopotential calculations. The formation energies follow the trend exhibited for the zinc-blende/wurtzite energy differences in the bulk materials, namely, lowest energy for GaN and highest for AIN. Type-I stacking faults have the lowest energy, followed by type-II stacking faults, and finally extrinsic stacking faults. We also examine a type of intrinsic stacking fault that has not, to the best of our knowledge, been previously discussed; its energy is slightly lower than the type-II faults. Investigations of the electronic structure reveal that there are no localized states in the band gap. However, stacking faults can bound a quantum-well-like region of zincblende material surrounded by the wurtzite host, giving rise to a luminescence line below the wurtzite band gap.},

	Abstract = {We report a state of the art density functional theory study of the intrinsic defects within the rocksalt-structured silver halides. These materials are well known to favor Frenkel defect pairs over Schottky pairs-a key factor in their use as photographic materials. We report the defect structures and formation energies of the elementary point defects obtained using the supercell approximation. In agreement with recent experimental results, we find that the interstitial cation adopts a split-interstitial configuration, centered on a lattice site. The effects of electron or hole trapping on the defect centers in AgCl and AgBr are reported, including the formation energetics, structures, and spin localizations. Although limitations in the supercell method are evident, we have nevertheless obtained valuable new insights into the properties of these fascinating materials.},

	Abstract = {We characterize the superionic phase transition and the lattice and electronic structures of the archetypal type-I superionic conductor alpha-AgI using extensive first-principles molecular dynamics calculations. We find that superionicity is signaled by a phase transition of the silver ions alone. In the superionic phase, the first silver shell surrounding an iodine displays a distinct dynamical structure that would escape a time-averaged characterization, and we capture this structure in a set of ordering rules. The electronic structure demonstrates a unique chemical signature of the weakest-bound silver in the first shell, which in turn is most likely to diffuse. Silver diffusion decreases upon melting, pointing to an unusual entropic contribution to the stability of the superionic phase.},

	Abstract = {The energetics and electronic structures of basal-plane stacking faults in wurtzite (WZ) ZnO are studied using first-principles density-functional total energy calculations. All the basal-plane stacking faults are found to have very low formations energies. They also introduce a downward shift at the conduction-band minimum (CBM). However, plane-averaged charge densities of the CBM state reveal that the CBM states are not very localized, indicating that these stacking faults should be electronically inert. The high concentration of these stacking faults can result in embedded zinc-blende (ZB) ZnO surrounded by WZ materials. The WZ/ZB interface exhibits a type-II lineup with DeltaE(V)approximate to0.037 eV and DeltaE(C)approximate to0.147 eV.},

	Abstract = {Modeling systems that are not inherently isotropic, e. g., extended bilayers, using molecular simulation techniques poses a potential problem. Since these methods rely on a finite number of atoms and molecules to describe the system, periodic boundary conditions are implemented to avoid edge effects and capture long-range electrostatic interactions. Systems consisting of a solvated bilayer adsorbed on a solid surface and exposed to an air/vacuum interface occur in many experimental settings and present some unique challenges in this respect. Here, we investigated the effects of implementing different electrostatic boundary conditions on the structural and electrostatic properties of [quartz/water/vacuum interface and [similar quartz-supported hydrated lipid bilayer exposed to vacuum. Since these interfacial systems have [net polarization, implementing the standard Ewald summation with the conducting boundary condition for the electrostatic long-range interactions introduced an artificial periodicity in the out-of-plane dimension. In particular, abnormal orientational polarizations of water were observed with the conducting boundary condition. Implementing the Ewald summation technique with the planar vacuum boundary condition and calculating electrostatic properties compatible with the implemented electrostatic boundary condition removed these inconsistencies. This formulation is generally applicable to similar interfacial systems in bulk solution. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3548836]},

	Abstract = {The equilibrium concentration of ionic and electronic charge carriers in ionic crystals as a function of temperature, concentration of dopants, and chemical environment is phenomenologically well understood as long as these point defects can be considered sufficiently dilute. However, there are cases, usually at temperatures close to the melting point, where the defects appear in higher concentrations. In these cases interactions come into play and cause anomalous increases in the conductivity or even phase transitions. Recently Hainovsky and Maier showed that for various Frenkel disordered materials this anomalous conductivity increase at high temperature can be described by a cube root term in the chemical potential of the defects. This quasi-Madelung approach does not only allow ionic conductivities and heat capacities to be computed, it also leads to a phenomenological understanding of the solid-liquid or superionic transition temperatures. In the present study we analyze this approach on the atomistic level for AgI: The defect concentrations as well as defect energies, including excess energies, are computed as a function of temperature by molecular-dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations based on a classical semiempirical potential. The simulations support the cube-root model, yield approximately the same interaction constants and show that the corrections in the chemical potential are of an energetic nature. In agreement with structural expectations, the simulations reveal that two different kinds of interstitials are present: Octahedral interstitials, which essentially determine the ionic transport at higher temperature, and tetrahedral ones, which remain substantially associated with the vacancies. It is shown how these refinements have to be introduced into the cube root. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S0021- 9606(00)70314-X].},

	Abstract = {Ab initio density functional calculations (plane wave GGA, CASTEP)
	were performed to determine the effect of O deficiency on the electronic
	structure of rutile, TiO2. O deficiency was introduced through either
	the removal of O or the insertion of interstitial Ti atoms. At physically
	realistic concentrations of O vacancies in the rutile lattice (i.e.
	25% and less) O deficiency results in the population of the bottom
	of the conduction band, the location of the Ti 3d orbitals in the
	pure structure, increasingly with increasing vacancy concentration.
	We propose that this could be confused with the formation and population
	of gap states especially where O vacancies occur in isolated positions
	in the lattice. In contrast, Ti interstitials introduce a defect
	state into the energy gap, without an overall reduction in the size
	of the energy gap. O vacancies result in a spin polarized solution,
	whereas Ti interstitials do not.},

	the onset of covalent interactions between Na atoms occurs for coverage
	slightly below 1/2 of monolayer, depending on the specific adsorption

	Abstract = {We propose a form for the exchange-correlation potential in local-density

	the ``constrained-local-density-approximation'' Hubbard parameter
	U as the quantity relating the single-particle potentials to the
	magnetic- (and orbital-) order parameters. Our energy functional
	is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation
	to the remaining part of the U term. We argue that such a method
	should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success
	of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations.
	Using this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal
	monoxides, as well as the parent compounds of the high-Tc compounds,
	are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type. Further,
	the method predicts that LiNiO2 is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS
	a local-moment p-type metal. The present version of the scheme fails

	Abstract = {A compilation and an implementation of different methodologies to
	simulate NPT ensembles on finite systems is presented. In general,
	the methods discussed can be classified in two different groups depending
	on how the external pressure is applied to the system. The first
	approach is based on including the pressure with its conjugate thermodynamical
	variable, the volume, in the Lagrangian of the system. For this group
	four different volume definitions were considered and we assess their
	validity by studying the structural properties of small systems as
	function of pressure. In particular, we focus on the stability of
	the C$_{60}$ molecule as well as the amorphization process of a diamond-like
	cluster under pressure. In the second group, the finite system (C$_{60}$)
	is embedded in a classical fluid which serves as a pressure reservoir.
	We take the latter method as reference because it is closest to the
	experimental situation. The difficulties and the regimes where these
	methods can be used are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The study of tin oxide is motivated by its applications as a solid
	state gas sensor material, oxidation catalyst, and transparent conductor.
	This review describes the physical and chemical properties that make
	tin oxide a suitable material for these purposes. The emphasis is
	on surface science studies of single crystal surfaces, but selected
	studies on powder and polycrystalline films are also incorporated
	in order to provide connecting points between surface science studies
	with the broader field of materials science of tin oxide. The key
	for understanding many aspects of SnO2 surface properties is the
	dual valency of Sn. The dual valency facilitates a reversible transformation
	of the surface composition from stoichiometric surfaces with Sn4+
	surface cations into a reduced surface with Sn2+ surface cations
	depending on the oxygen chemical potential of the system. Reduction
	of the surface modifies the surface electronic structure by formation
	of Sn 5s derived surface states that lie deep within the band gap
	and also cause a lowering of the work function. The gas sensing mechanism
	appears, however, only to be indirectly influenced by the surface
	composition of SnO2. Critical for triggering a gas response are not
	the lattice oxygen concentration but chemisorbed (or ionosorbed)
	oxygen and other molecules with a net electric charge. Band bending
	induced by charged molecules cause the increase or decrease in surface
	conductivity responsible for the gas response signal. In most applications
	tin oxide is modified by additives to either increase the charge
	carrier concentration by donor atoms, or to increase the gas sensitivity
	or the catalytic activity by metal additives. Some of the basic concepts
	by which additives modify the gas sensing and catalytic properties
	of SnO2 are discussed and the few surface science studies of doped
	SnO2 are reviewed. Epitaxial SnO2 films may facilitate the surface
	science studies of doped films in the future. To this end film growth
	on titania, alumina, and Pt(1 1 1) is reviewed. Thin films on alumina
	also make promising test systems for probing gas sensing behavior.
	Molecular adsorption and reaction studies on SnO2 surfaces have been
	hampered by the challenges of preparing well-characterized surfaces.
	Nevertheless some experimental and theoretical studies have been
	performed and are reviewed. Of particular interest in these studies
	was the influence of the surface composition on its chemical properties.
	Finally, the variety of recently synthesized tin oxide nanoscopic
	materials is summarized.},

	peak shapes are characterized by photoemission spectroscopy. Surface
	morphologies are characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy.
	N-dopants are observed to be in a 3− charge state and to substitute
	for O-anions in the TiO2 lattice for N-concentrations up to not,
	vert, ~5% of the anions. The higher valency of the N-dopants compared
	to the host O-anions is proposed to be compensated by the formation
	of O-vacancies and/or Ti-interstitials. Two chemically shifted components
	arise in the Ti-2p core level upon N-doping. These components, shifted
	by 0.9 eV and 2.1 eV, are assigned to Ti-bound to N-ligands and possibly
	due to O-vacancies in the lattice. The Ti-3d band gap state observed
	in UPS is initially suppressed upon room temperature N-implantation
	and recovers a similar intensity as for undoped TiO2 samples upon
	annealing. This indicates that electrons left behind upon creation
	of O-vacancies are filling the N-2p level rather than Ti-3d states.
	The filled N-2p state is found at the top of the TiO2 valence band

	TiO2 powders were studied by a combination of electron paramagnetic
	resonance and infrared spectroscopy measurements. During continuous
	UV irradiation in the mW.cm-2 range, photogenerated electrons are
	either trapped at localized sites, giving paramagnetic Ti3+ centers,
	or remain in the conduction band as EPR silent species which may
	be observed by their IR absorption. Using low temperatures (90 K)
	to reduce the rate of the electron-hole recombination processes,
	trapped electrons and conduction band electrons exhibit lifetimes
	of hours. The EPR-detected holes produced by photoexcitation are
	O- species, produced from lattice O2- ions. It is found that under
	high vacuum conditions, the major fraction of photoexcited electrons
	remains in the conduction band. At 298 K, all stable hole and electron
	states are lost from TiO2. Defect sites produced by oxygen removal
	during annealing of anatase TiO2 are found to produce a Ti3+ EPR
	spectrum identical to that of trapped electrons, which originate
	from photoexcitation of oxidized TiO2. Efficient electron scavenging
	by adsorbed O2 at 140 K is found to produce two long-lived O2- surface
	species associated with different cation surface sites. Reduced TiO2,
	produced by annealing in vacuum, has been shown to be less efficient
	in hole trapping than oxidized TiO2.},

	Using a single-molecule R3m unit cell, the energetic and dynamical

	and the effects of the external pressure on this profile. The geometry
	and energy of the transition state are determined, and the bonding
	details of the transformation identified. The proposed mechanism
	explains the change in coordination from 4 (B3) to 6 (B1), the less
	covalent Zn--O bond in the B1 structure, and the transformation of
	ZnO from a direct-gap (B3) to an indirect-gap (B1) material.},

	processes. Methanol adsorbs dissociatively, and the adsorption energy
	becomes less exothermic in the series H-Li-Na-K which corresponds

	Abstract = {We present a study concerning the effect of the on site d-d Coulomb
	interaction energy U on the band-gap states of nonstoichiometric
	rutile (110) TiO2 surface. As well known, the excess electrons resulting
	from the formation of oxygen vacancies localize on the Ti 3d orbitals
	forming band-gap states. Local density approximation (LDA) does not
	give a correct description of these band-gap states, either with
	or without gradient corrections. The failure of LDA is often attributed
	to an inadequate treatment of electron correlation in systems with
	localized orbitals and is commonly corrected with an empirical local
	Coulomb repulsion term, i.e., the LDA+U method. This study provides
	a completely general strategy to estimate the U value in this kind
	of systems, illustrated here for reduced (110) TiO2 surface, well
	characterized from experiments. From ab initio embedded cluster configuration
	interaction calculations, combined with the effective Hamiltonian
	theory, a value of U of 5.5$\pm$0.5 eV is obtained, in good agreement
	with those reported for this system from x-ray photoemission spectroscopy
	experiments (U=4.5$\pm$0.5 eV). It is observed that when the ab initio
	estimate of U is injected into the periodic LDA+U calculations, a
	correct description of the gap states is obtained from the periodic
	LDA+U calculations. Additionally, the results indicate that the position
	of these states on the band gap strongly depends on the level at
	which lattice relaxation is taken into account, with significant
	differences between the density of states curves at the LDA+U level
	obtained using the optimal generalized gradient approximation or
	LDA+U geometries. These results suggest that this combined strategy
	could be a useful tool for those systems where electron correlation
	plays a key role, and no experimental data are available for the

	for the (0 0 0Image-surface, where the Zn--O double-layer separation
	decreased to 48% of the bulk value. The calculated bandstructure
	revealed an occupied pz-surface state on the (0 0 0Image-surface,
	strongly localized to the surface O-atoms. The conduction band on
	the (0 0 0 1)-surface was split off from the bulk region to form
	a 2D metallic surface state. This enabled charge transfer from the
	(0 0 0Image- to the (0 0 0 1)-surface to quench the intrinsic dipole
	by a similar process that has been observed previously on the unreconstructed
	MgO(1 1 1)-surface.},

	Abstract = {The atomic and electronic structure, formation energy, and the energy
	barriers for migration have been calculated for the neutral O vacancy
	point defect (F center) in cubic SrTiO$_3$ employing various implementations
	of density functional theory (DFT). Both bulk and TiO$_2$-terminated
	(001) surface F centers have been considered. Supercells of different
	shapes containing up to 320 atoms have been employed. The limit of
	an isolated single oxygen vacancy in the bulk corresponds to a 270-atom
	supercell, in contrast to commonly used supercells containing ~40--80
	atoms. Calculations carried out with the hybrid B3PW functional show
	that the F center level approaches the conduction band bottom to
	within 0.5 eV, as the supercell size increases up to 320 atoms.
	The analysis of the electronic density maps indicates, however, that
	this remains a small-radius center with the two electrons left by
	the missing O ion being redistributed mainly between the vacancy
	and the 3d($z^2) atomic orbitals of the two nearest Ti ions. As for
	the dynamical properties, the calculated migration energy barrier
	in the low oxygen depletion regime is predicted to be 0.4 eV. In
	contrast, the surface F center exhibits a more delocalized character,
	which leads to significantly reduced ionization and migration energies.
	Results obtained are compared with available experimental data.},

	Different ab initio approaches have been tested including unrestricted

	a 20% fraction of Hartree-Fock exchange) has been selected because

	Abstract = {We examine the real space structure and the electronic structure (particularly
	Ce4f electron localization) of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 (ceria) as
	a function of U in density functional theory studies with the rotationally
	invariant forms of the LDA+U and GGA+U functionals. The four nearest
	neighbor Ce ions always relax outwards, with those not carrying localized
	Ce4f charge moving furthest. Several quantification schemes show
	that the charge starts to become localized at U[approximate]3 eV
	and that the degree of localization reaches a maximum at ~6 eV for
	LDA+U or at ~5.5 eV for GGA+U. For higher U it decreases rapidly
	as charge is transferred onto second neighbor O ions and beyond.
	The localization is never into atomic corelike states; at maximum
	localization about 80--90% of the Ce4f charge is located on the two
	nearest neighboring Ce ions. However, if we look at the total atomic
	charge we find that the two ions only make a net gain of (0.2--0.4)e
	each, so localization is actually very incomplete, with localization
	of Ce4f electrons coming at the expense of moving other electrons
	off the Ce ions. We have also revisited some properties of defect-free
	ceria and find that with LDA+U the crystal structure is actually
	best described with U=3--4 eV, while the experimental band structure
	is obtained with U=7--8 eV. (For GGA+U the lattice parameters worsen
	for U>0 eV, but the band structure is similar to LDA+U.) The best
	overall choice is U[approximate]6 eV with LDA+U and [approximate]5.5
	eV for GGA+U, since the localization is most important, but a consistent
	choice for both CeO2 and Ce2O3, with and without vacancies, is hard

	Abstract = {The role of chemical and pressure changes on the structural stability
	of simple binary crystals is examined. We have considered crystals
	of the form ANB8-N in three experimentally accessible structures:
	zinc blende, rocksalt, and β-Sn. The total energy of a reference
	crystal in these structures was calculated via a pseudopotential
	method as a function of charge transfer and pressure. We construct
	a phase diagram in pressure--charge-transfer space which enables us
	to predict the global behavior of this family of crystal structures.
	The structural boundaries of this phase diagram are in good agreement
	with experiment and the pressures predicted for structural transitions
	are in semiquantitative agreement with experiment. From our calculations
	we are able to define an ionicity scale based on charge transfer
	which predicts the critical ionicity for separating the zinc-blende
	and rocksalt structures. Our charge-transfer scale is consistent
	with the Phillips ionicity scale and provides a microscopic justification
	for the dielectric scale. Finally, for the case of the rocksalt structure,
	we can associate the band gap of this material with its structural
	stability relative to the zinc-blende structure. Specifically, as
	a function of charge transfer we find a metal-insulator transition
	occurs near the point when the rocksalt structure becomes stable
	versus a zinc-blende structure.},

	H+, O+, and H3O+ were the primary cationic desorption products with
	H+ as the dominant channel. H+, H3O+, and O+ have a 22 eV threshold
	followed by a yield change around 40 eV. H+ also has an additional
	yield change ~75 eV and O+ has an additional change ~150 eV. The

	Abstract = {Reaction mechanisms for the interactions between CeO2(111) and (110)
	surfaces are investigated using periodic density functional theory
	(DFT) calculations. Both standard DFT and DFT+U calculations to examine
	the effect of the localization of Ce 4f states on the redox chemistry
	of H2-CeO2 interactions are described. For mechanistic studies, molecular
	and dissociative local minima are initially located by placing an
	H2 molecule at various active sites of the CeO2 surfaces. The binding
	energies of physisorbed species optimized using the DFT and DFT+U
	methods are very weak. The dissociative adsorption reactions producing
	hydroxylated surfaces are all exothermic; exothermicities at the
	DFT level range from 4.1 kcal mol-1 for the (111) to 26.5 kcal mol-1
	for the (110) surface, while those at the DFT+U level are between
	65.0 kcal mol-1 for the (111) and 81.8 kcal mol-1 for the (110) surface.
	Predicted vibrational frequencies of adsorbed OH and H2O species
	on the surfaces are in line with available experimental and theoretical
	results. Potential energy profiles are constructed by connecting
	molecularly adsorbed and dissociatively adsorbed intermediates on
	each CeO2 surface with tight transition states using the nudged elastic
	band (NEB) method. It is found that the U correction method plays
	a significant role in energetics, especially for the intermediates
	of the exit channels and products that are partially reduced. The
	surface reduction reaction on CeO2(110) is energetically much more
	favorable. Accordingly, oxygen vacancies are more easily formed on
	the (110) surface than on the (111) surface.},

	Abstract = {Structural properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles are theoretically
	studied focusing on the effects induced by the surfaces. In this
	aim, we compare two models: an atomistic and an elastic model. Atomistic
	model uses a semiempirical potential: the shell model. Effects of
	surface relaxation and surface stress are taken into account in this
	model while they were not in the elastic model. Studying nanoparticles
	with sizes varying from 1.5 to 4.5 nm, we show that surface relaxation
	occurs on a typical length of about 1 nm in the vicinity of surfaces
	within the atomistic model. This significant length is due to the
	existence of long-range interaction forces in zinc oxide which is
	an ionocovalent material. Because this typical length is comparable
	to nanoparticle size, elasticity fails to reproduce correctly structural
	properties of the nanoparticles. As an illustration of structural
	properties changes by decreasing nanoparticles sizes, we study the
	nanoparticles acoustic vibrations eigenfrequencies focusing on the
	mostly observable modes by vibration spectroscopy. Differences between
	elasticity and atomistic calculations are attributed to surface effects.
	If elasticity acceptably provides vibration frequencies of most studied
	nanoparticles, it fails to reproduce them for nanoparticles with
	a size below an approximate value of 2.5 nm. We expect such effects
	to be experimentally observable.},

	potential energy model, to simulate AlN nanocrystals. The main advantages
	of this approach are a greatly reduced dimensionality and the ability
	to incorporate external pressure effects at the cost of neglecting
	geometric surface relaxation. The results suggest that small-size
	nanocrystals display graphitic-like layers, nonbuckled, as opposed
	to the buckled bulk wurtzite structure; buckling will dominate after
	a given, quite large, threshold. The surface tension, c/a ratio,
	and equation of state are examined with respect to variations on
	both pressure and nanocrystal size. It is found that, although the
	bulk modulus of the wurtzite-like phase is smaller (although decreasing
	with size) in nanocrystals than in the bulk, the nonbuckled phase
	displays a larger modulus, in agreement with the experiments. The
	transition pressure into the rocksalt-like phase increases with system
	size, with the dependence being linear against 1/N1/3. This is rationalized

	Abstract = {State-of-the-art electronic-structure calculations based on the local-density
	approximation (LDA) to the density functional fail to reproduce the
	insulating antiferromagnetic ground state in the parent compounds
	of the high-temperature oxide superconductors. Similar problems have
	been observed earlier in classical transition-metal oxides such as
	FeO, CoO, and NiO. In this work we present the method which delivers
	the correct insulating antiferromagnet ground state in the correlated
	oxides preserving other properties as well as the efficiency of the
	standard LDA. The method embeds the relevant (for a given system
	of electrons) part of the Hubbard Hamiltonian into the Kohn-Sham
	LDA equation. The resulting Hamiltonian attempts to fix two intrinsic
	problems of the LDA: the deficiency in forming localized (atomiclike)
	moments and the lack of discontinuity of the effective one-particle
	potential when going from occupied to unoccupied states. We present
	the detailed study of La$_2$CuO$_4$ and LaCuO$_3$. In the case of
	La$_2$CuO$_4$ the energy gap and the value of the localized magnetic
	moment in the stable insulating antiferromagnetic solution are in
	good agreement with experiment. We compare our results with standard
	local spin density approximation calculation and multiband Hubbard
	model calculations, as well as with results of spectroscopy: inverse
	photoemission, valence photoemission, and x-ray absorption at the
	K edge of oxygen. In the case of LaCuO$_3$ such an extensive comparison
	is limited due to the limited data available for this compound. We
	discuss, however, the electric and magnetic properties and the insulator-metal-insulator
	transitions upon increase of oxygen deficiency.},

	within the density-functional theory. The pressure dependence of
	the zone-center phonons (E2, A1, and E1) was measured for the wurtzite
	structure up to the hexagonal?cubic transition near 9 GPa. Above
	this pressure no active mode was observed. The only negative Gr{\"u}neisen
	parameter is that of the E2low mode. E1(LO) and (TO) frequencies
	increase with increasing pressure. The corresponding perpendicular
	tensor component of the Born's transverse dynamic charge eT* is experimentally
	found to increase under compression like eT*(P)=2.02+6.4×10-3P, whereas
	calculations give eT*(P)=2.09--2.5×10-3P (in units of the elementary
	charge e, P in GPa). In both cases, the pressure variation is small,
	indicating a weak dependence of the bond ionicity with pressure.
	The pressure dependence of the optical mode energies is also compared

	work done on this system in our groups in recent years. The analysis
	is largely based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra

	N-doped anatase TiO2 contains thermally stable single N-atom impurities
	either as charged diamagnetic N$_b^-$ source centers or as neutral
	paramagnetic N$_b^\cdot$ source centers (b stays for bulk). The N-atoms
	can occupy both interstitial or substitutional positions in the solid,
	with some evidence for a preference for interstitial sites. All types
	of Nb centers give rise to localized states in the band-gap of the
	oxide, thus accounting for the related reduction of absorption band
	edge. The relative abundance of these species depends on the oxidation
	state of the solid. In fact, upon reduction, oxygen vacancies form
	and transfer electrons from Ti3+ ions to the $N_b^\cdot$ with formation
	of Ti4+ and $N_b^\cdot$. EPR spectra measured under irradiation show
	that the Nb centers are responsible for visible light absorption
	with promotion of electrons from the localized N-impurity states
	to the conduction band or to electron scavengers like O2 adsorbed

	(visible region) observed in the case of N-doped TiO2 with respect
	to pure TiO2 (UV region). Calculations also show that nitrogen doping
	leads to a substantial reduction of the energy cost to form oxygen
	vacancies in bulk TiO2. This suggests that nitrogen doping is likely
	to be accompanied by oxygen vacancy formation. Finally, we propose
	that the relative abundance of the two observed nitrogen-doping species
	depends on the preparation conditions, such as the oxygen concentration
	in the atmosphere and the annealing temperature during synthesis.},

	Abstract = {Titanium dioxide is the most investigated single-crystalline system
	in the surface science of metal oxides, and the literature on rutile
	(1 1 0), (1 0 0), (0 0 1), and anatase surfaces is reviewed. This
	paper starts with a summary of the wide variety of technical fields
	where TiO2 is of importance. The bulk structure and bulk defects
	(as far as relevant to the surface properties) are briefly reviewed.
	Rules to predict stable oxide surfaces are exemplified on rutile
	(1 1 0). The surface structure of rutile (1 1 0) is discussed in
	some detail. Theoretically predicted and experimentally determined
	relaxations of surface geometries are compared, and defects (step
	edge orientations, point and line defects, impurities, surface manifestations
	of crystallographic shear planes---CSPs) are discussed, as well as
	the image contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The controversy
	about the correct model for the (1×2) reconstruction appears to be
	settled. Different surface preparation methods, such as reoxidation
	of reduced crystals, can cause a drastic effect on surface geometries
	and morphology, and recommendations for preparing different TiO2(1
	1 0) surfaces are given. The structure of the TiO2(1 0 0)-(1×1) surface
	is discussed and the proposed models for the (1×3) reconstruction
	are critically reviewed. Very recent results on anatase (1 0 0) and
	(1 0 1) surfaces are included.
	
	
	The electronic structure of stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces is now well
	understood. Surface defects can be detected with a variety of surface
	spectroscopies. The vibrational structure is dominated by strong
	Fuchs--Kliewer phonons, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectra
	often need to be deconvoluted in order to render useful information
	about adsorbed molecules.
	
	
	The growth of metals (Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Al, Ti, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn,
	Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) as well as some metal oxides
	on TiO2 is reviewed. The tendency to `wet' the overlayer, the growth
	morphology, the epitaxial relationship, and the strength of the interfacial
	oxidation/reduction reaction all follow clear trends across the periodic
	table, with the reactivity of the overlayer metal towards oxygen
	being the most decisive factor. Alkali atoms form ordered superstructures
	at low coverages. Recent progress in understanding the surface structure
	of metals in the `strong-metal support interaction' (SMSI) state
	is summarized.
	
	
	Literature is reviewed on the adsorption and reaction of a wide variety
	of inorganic molecules (H2, O2, H2O, CO, CO2, N2, NH3, NOx, sulfur-
	and halogen-containing molecules, rare gases) as well as organic
	molecules (carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, alkynes,
	pyridine and its derivates, silanes, methyl halides). The application
	of TiO2-based systems in photo-active devices is discussed, and the
	results on UHV-based photocatalytic studies are summarized.
	
	
	The review ends with a brief conclusion and outlook of TiO2-based
	surface science for the future.},

	Abstract = {The electronic properties and stabilities of SnO and SnO2 bulk materials
	and their low-index surfaces are investigated by density functional
	theory. An empirical method has been adopted in this study to account
	for the van der Waals interactions among the Sn-O layers in the bulk
	and low-index surfaces of SnO. Compared with SnO2, the structural
	and electronic properties of SnO bulk and its low-index surfaces
	present some unique features due to the dual valency of Sn. In SnO,
	the s orbital of Sn has larger contributions than its p and d orbitals
	in the first valence band (VB) and the p orbital of Sn has a larger
	contribution than its s and d orbitals in its conduction band (CB).
	In SnO2, the p and d orbitals of Sn play an important role to form
	the upper part of the VB and its s orbital dominates in forming the
	lower parts of the VB and the CB. In both oxides, the s orbital of
	O forms the second VB with lower energy and its p orbitals are involved
	in forming the first VB and the CB. The calculated bulk modulus and
	cohesive energy agree well with the experimental measurements. By
	constructing all possible symmetrical low-index surfaces of SnO and
	the (111) surface of SnO2, our results reveal that the calculated
	surface energies of SnO stoichiometric surfaces are lower than that
	of the corresponding surfaces of SnO2 due to different bonding between
	Sn and O in these two oxides. The calculated stabilities of the low-index
	stoichiometric surfaces of SnO are in the order (001)>(101)/(011)>=(010)/(100)>(110)>(111)
	while the order in the case of SnO2 is (110)>(010)/(100)>(101)/(011)>(001)>(111).
	The calculated relationships between surface free energies [gamma(p,T)]
	and oxygen chemical potentials [µO(p,T)] indicate that the nonstoichiometric
	O-terminated (110) and (111) surfaces of SnO could be more stable
	than their corresponding stoichiometric ones when the µO(p,T) reaches
	its higher O-rich bound, and one Sn-terminated nonstoichiometric
	(111) surface of SnO2 could be more stable than its stoichiometric
	ones when the µO(p,T) falls into its lower O-poor region. During
	surface formation from the bulk, the stable surface usually has small
	atom displacements. For both SnO and SnO2 the atoms on the (111)
	surface have larger relaxations than on their other low-index surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Annealing TiO2(110) in vacuum at high temperature (above about 800
	K) generates oxygen vacancy sites that are associated with reduced
	surface cations. Numerous studies have shown that these sites can
	be oxidized by exposure to molecular oxygen, but the mechanism and
	temperature dependence of this oxidation process are not well understood.
	We present results that suggest low temperature (<600 K) O2 exposure
	oxidizes oxygen vacancies but also leaves oxygen-containing species
	on the surface that we propose are oxygen adatoms. The presence of
	these oxygen adatoms is evident in the temperature-programmed desorption
	(TPD) spectrum of water. Oxidizing the vacuum annealed surface at
	700 K produces a fully oxidized TiO2(110) surface that gives a single
	monolayer TPD state for water at 270 K. Exposing the vacuum annealed
	surface to O2 at temperatures between 90 and 600 K followed by water
	adsorption at 90 K results in a new water TPD state 25 K higher in
	temperature. Similar results were obtained using ammonia instead
	of water. Isotopic labeling experiments, in which the vacuum annealed
	surface was dosed with Image at 135 K followed by Image at 135 K,
	indicate that the new water TPD state results from recombinative
	desorption, whereas no such effect is observed for the surface exposed
	to Image at 700 K. The effect on water is also absent in TPD if the
	low temperature O2 treated surface is heated to 600 K prior to water
	adsorption at 90 K, suggesting that the oxygen adatoms desorb from
	the surface or diffuse into the bulk. We propose that at low temperatures,
	O2 dissociates at oxygen vacancies filling each defect site with
	one O atom and depositing a second O adatom at a five-coordinate
	Ti4+ site or that O2 interacts with surface hydroxyl groups resulting
	in O2 dissociation and the presence of the O adatom. The new dissociative
	water chemistry results from the interaction of water molecules with
	these oxygen adatoms. After high temperature (>600 K) O2 exposure,
	no dissociative water chemistry is observed, suggesting that these
	oxygen adatoms are not present on the surface. The presence of surface
	O adatoms may explain inconsistencies in the literature regarding
	the reactivity of water, and potentially other species, on TiO2(110).
	These results also detail the importance of sample preparation techniques
	on the chemistry which can occur at a solid surface.},

	Based on optical measurements the presence of an indirect band gap

	of O 2p and In 4d orbitals off $\Gamma$. We have performed extensive

	We have also studied the effect of oxygen vacancies, which turned

	the presence of impurities is related to a higher vacancy concentration.

	functional theory (DFT) comparing plane wave density functional theory
	with the Hubbard correction DFT+U with atomic-orbital-hybrid-functional

	description of the nature of the oxygen vacancy. At variance with
	the same defect center in MgO, where two electrons are trapped in
	the vacancy, on NiO the charge is more delocalized, partly over the
	Ni ions around the vacancy, the rest either trapped in the vacancy
	or delocalized over other Ni ions. Concerning the nickel vacancy,
	both methods clearly show that the removal of a neutral Ni atom does
	not result in the oxidation of other nickel ions from Ni2+ to Ni3+
	but rather in the formation of two holes in the O 2p valence band.
	However, the description is slightly different with the approaches,
	the hybrid functional indicates that the holes are essentially localized
	on the oxygen ions nearest to the vacancy, while they result much
	more delocalized from the DFT+U calculation. Comparison with the

	Abstract = {We report the results of density functional theory calculations on
	the electronic structure of boron-doped anatase TiO2. For the calculations
	we used both standard and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals.
	On the basis of a close comparison of computed and measured observable
	properties, in particular hyperfine coupling constants from electron
	paramagnetic resonance experiments and core level binding energies
	from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra, we propose the existence
	of both substitutional to oxygen and interstitial boron atoms in
	the bulk of anatase. Boron substitional to oxygen results in a paramagnetic
	defect, [BTi3]*, which introduces new states in the midgap of the
	material. The analysis of the stability of this center, however,
	shows that it should not be the dominant species and should convert
	into interstitial boron after annealing at high temperature. Various
	possible sites for interstitial boron have been considered where
	the dopant is coordinated to three, [BO3], or to four, [BO4], oxygen
	atoms. The electronic characteristics of interstitial boron are rather
	independent of the site where the atom is incorporated. Boron in
	interstitial positions behaves as a three-electron donor with formation
	of B3+ and reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. The possible copresence of
	substitutional and interstitial boron could also result in internal
	charge transfer leading to more complex situations.},

	consists of the electrostatic energy of charged surfaces and the

	that the phase stability of titania (TiO2) nanoparticles strongly

	solutions anatase is stabilized relative to rutile and brookite.
	Rutile is the stable phase at large particle sizes regardless of

	the phase stability of nanoparticulate titania in aqueous solutions

	moments are determined for all the core edges, vanadium and oxygen
	K- and vanadium L-edges, treating them at the same level of accuracy.
	The agreement between the TDDFT theoretical spectra and the experimental
	data is rather good, particularly at the V and O K-edges. A quantitative
	reproduction of the fine pre-edge structures appears more difficult
	for the V L-edge. The comparison between the TDDFT results and the
	results obtained at the simpler one electron Kohn-Sham (KS) level
	indicates that the V and O K edges can be correctly described within
	a single particle approximation (KS), while the strong modification
	of the V L-edge structures from the KS to the TDDFT description emphasizes
	the importance of configuration mixing to treat the metal 2p excitations.
	The origin of the calculated pre-edge features is analyzed in detail
	with the help of the atom-projected density-of-states of the unoccupied
	levels. This analysis emphasizes the V 3d dominant character of the

	The strong octahedral distortion of the V2O5 structure allows the

	Abstract = {It has previously been reported that under high-pressure V2O5 (-V2O5)
	transforms into a layered polymorph, -V2O5, consisting of V5+O6 octahedra
	instead of V5+O5-square pyramids. Both polymorphs have a good performance
	as positive electrode for lithium batteries. In this work, we investigate
	the pressure-induced transformation combining first principles and
	experimental methods. Density functional theory (DFT) predicts that
	-V2O5 transforms to -V2O5 at 3.3 GPa with a 11% volume contraction;
	experiments corroborate that at a pressure of 4 GPa, V2O5 (d = 3.36
	g/cm3) transformed into a well-crystallized -V2O5, with a much denser
	structure (d = 3.76 g/cm3). -V2O5 can be also prepared at 3 GPa,
	although with a substantial degree of amorphization. The calculated
	bulk modulus of -V2O5 (18 GPa) indicates that this is a very compressible
	structure; this being linked to the contraction along its b-axis
	(interlayer space) and to a significant decrease of a long V-O distance
	(V-O 2.9 {\AA}). As a result, the vanadium coordination increases from
	five (square pyrmamid) in -V2O5 to six (distorted octahedron), leading
	to the stabilization of the high-pressure () polymorph. This change
	of the coordination environment of vanadium ions also affects the
	electrical conductivity. The calculated density of states shows a
	narrowing of 0.5 V in the band gap for the polymorph, in comparison
	to the ambient-pressure material; the measured resistivities at room
	temperature (10 000 cm in -polymorph and 400 cm in -polymorph) reveal
	that -V2O5 is indeed a better electronic conductor than -V2O5. In
	view of these results, similar transformations at moderate pressures
	are expected to occur in other V5+ frameworks, suggesting an interesting
	way to synthesize novel V5+ compounds with potential for electrochemical
	devices.},

	[var epsilon] --> [delta], [delta] --> [gamma] have been described,
	as well as the transformations by crystallographic shears, slips,
	and VO5 SP reversal of [var epsilon] (or [alpha]) into the 3-D networks
	of [beta] or [beta]'-MxV2O5 phases. The complete LixV2O5 system versus
	f(T, x) is described and the evolution of the cell parameters for

	the puckering angle [mu] of the S layers. The demonstration of the
	slipping of the S layers quantified by shift [Delta], expressed as
	a fraction or unit of the height of an octahedron, has made it possible
	to propose various original stackings for these layers; some ideal

	Abstract = {The defect-free V2O5(001) surface and ordered structures involving
	oxygen vacancies have been studied for a wide range of defect concentrations,
	Q (1/6{\o}Q{\o}1 monolayer, ML), combining density functional theory and
	statistical thermodynamics. At Q=1/4 ML the oxygen vacancy formation
	energy for the singly coordinated surface oxygen atoms (vanadyl oxygen,
	O1) is by ,1.7 eV/atom and ,2.0 eV/atom lower than the corresponding
	values for two- and threefold coordinated surface oxygen atoms, respectively.
	Between 1/3 and 1/2 ML the alignment of vanadyl oxygen vacancies
	(O$_mathrm{vac}^1$) along the [010] direction is by 70 meV/atom (Q
	=1/3 ML) and 120 meV/atom (Q=1/2 ML) more favorable than along the
	[100] direction, with the concentration-induced change of the vacancy
	formation energy for structures with vacancies aligned along the
	[100] direction being smaller than 20 meV/atom. The lowest vacancy
	formation energy of 1.87 eV/atom corresponds to the (1$\times$1)-O$_\matrhrm{vac}^$1
	(Q=1/2 ML) phase with defects forming a trenchlike structure with

	[010] direction provide preferred paths for continuous reduction
	of the surface starting from isolated defect sites. However, this

	electron, and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopies. The experimental
	results are compared with one-electron band-structure calculations

	demonstrated that the results for Cu2O agree well with band theory,
	whereas those for CuO clearly show strong deviations which we argue
	are due to electron-correlation effects in the open-shell d bands.
	From the comparison to cluster calculations we extract values for

	energy, and the degree of Cu d-O 2p hybridization. From this we demonstrate
	that CuO is a charge-transfer gap insulator.},

	from an ab initio perspective using density functional theory. The
	considered defects are isolated Schottky and Frenkel defects and
	interstitial pairs, along with a number of Schottky defects and di-interstitials.
	Comparisons were made between the density functional theory results
	and results obtained from empirical potential simulations and these
	generally showed good agreement. Both methodologies predicted the
	first nearest neighbor Schottky defects to be the most energetically
	favorable of the considered Schottky defects and that the first,

	Relaxed structures of the defects were analyzed, which showed that
	empirical potential simulations were accurately predicting the displacements

	atom displacement for Schottky defects. Transition barriers were
	computed for the defects using the nudged elastic band method. Vacancies

	of 55 $\pm$ 10 kJ/mol, consistent with atom displacement rather than
	bond breaking. At 50 C, aggregate restructuring occurred, increasing
	the transition kinetics beyond the rate expected for water adsorption

	Abstract = {A realistic model, consisting of six-layer slabs, and density-functional
	calculations were used to perform a detailed analysis of the structural
	and electronic properties of N doped TiO2(110). All the positions
	examined for adsorption of atomic N are unstable regarding the formation
	and further escape of N2(g). The adsorption of atomic N could take
	place only when having isolated adatoms. In this case, N prefers
	to bond to O centers located either on the surface or in the interstitial
	channels of the oxide lattice. These N adatoms probably give rise
	to the peak seen at ~400 eV in N 1s XPS spectra. The coexistence
	of N with O vacancies and surface reconstructions are explained in
	terms of cooperative behaviors and the special electronic structure
	of the TiNxO2-2x(110) system. Here, electrons move from the O vacancies
	to implanted N to fill up its electronic shell. Such electron transfer
	yields the normal oxidation state of nitrogen, N3-, and explains
	a number of things: the easiness to form O vacancies when implanted
	N is present, the easiness to implant N when O vacancies are present,
	and the difficulty for the implanted N to escape. It is not likely
	that N-doping will improve the photocatalytic behavior of TiO2-x(110)
	surfaces. For these compounds the band gap will be always equal or
	larger than that of pure stoichiometric TiO2.},

@article{HallilEtAl_PhysRevB2006,
	Abstract = {In this paper, interatomic potential models used for atomistic simulations
	of insulating oxides are revisited through the example of TiO2 rutile.
	The cohesive energy of oxides comprises an electrostatic part and
	a short-range part whose relative importance differs with the models.
	The electrostatic part can be evaluated by considering either point
	fixed atomic charges or, alternatively, charges that are allowed
	to vary in response to the local atomic environment, with a shielding
	correction to coulombic interactions at short range. We deeply analyzed
	this latter approach in the framework of the Rapp{\'e} and Goddard QEq
	charge equilibration scheme. We conclude that it is an efficient
	model to describe heterogeneous situations due to point defects or
	surfaces. Moreover, whatever the description of the electrostatic
	part of the energy is, several short-range interatomic potentials
	are found to describe in an acceptable way the crystal bulk properties
	(cohesive energy, elastic constants, etc). To compare the efficiency
	of various short-range potentials, we selected the TiO2 rutile whose
	experimental formation energy of the oxygen vacancy is available.
	By combining it with the cohesive energy, we have been able to accurately
	analyze the energetics of TiO2 as a function of those potentials.
	In this paper we show first that Morse potential is not adapted to
	oxygen-oxygen interactions and that pair-wise potentials between
	Ti-O pairs are not suitable to describe defects. As a result, we
	propose a model that combines the QEq description for electrostatic
	energy, a Buckingham potential for O-O interactions and a N-body
	potential for the covalent part of the Ti-O interactions. This model
	efficiency has been tested on bulk, oxygen vacancy, and surfaces
	of rutile and turned out to provide results which fit very satisfactorily
	the experimental data.},

	low formation energies and they are the relevant defects in CuAlO2.

	copper vacancy induce no deep levels in the band gap. Our results

	Abstract = {The effect of surface oxygen vacancies on the adsorption and clustering
	of the Pt adatoms over the defective anatase TiO2(101) surface has
	been studied using density functional theory slab calculations. The
	surface oxygen vacancy site was found to be the most active site
	for a single Pt adatom with an adsorption energy of 4.87 eV. As such,
	this site may act as a nucleation center for particle growth on the
	defective anatase TiO2(101) surface. The pathways for forming the
	two stable Pt2 adsorption configurations from a single Pt adatom
	in the oxygen vacancy site and another from the neighboring bridging
	2cO sites involve the diffusion of the second Pt adatom out of the
	bridging 2cO site. The transition states for the dimer formation
	were located at Pt adatom diffusing out of the bridging 2cO site.
	Furthermore, we found that the bond-breaking step determines the
	barrier height for the Pt adatom diffusion, which is ~1 eV. Among
	five stable Pt3 adsorption structures at the oxygen vacancy site
	on the defective anatase TiO2(101), the most stable structure is
	triangular with all three Pt atoms interacting directly with the
	surface atoms. The possible pathways for Pt adatom diffusion to form
	the most stable Pt3 configuration were analyzed. The barriers for
	Pt adatom diffusion in Pt3 formation were predicted to be similar
	to that of the Pt2 formation due to similar transition state structures.
	The barrier height indicates that clustering will be kinetically
	hindered at low temperature.},

@article{HendersonEtAl_SurfSci2003,
	Abstract = {We present X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature
	programmed desorption (TPD) results probing the surface chemistry
	of water on the oxidized and reduced surfaces of a 500 {\AA} epitaxial
	CeO2(1 1 1) film grown on yttria-stabilized ZrO2(1 1 1). Oxidation
	with O2 at 773 K under UHV conditions was sufficient to generate
	XPS spectra reflective of fully oxidized CeO2(1 1 1). Surface reduction
	was carried out by annealing in UHV between 773 and 973 K, and the
	level of reduction was quantified using changes in the Ce3d3/2 4f0
	photoemission peak at 917 eV which results primarily from Ce4+ sites.
	As expected, the level of surface reduction (generation of Ce3+ sites)
	increased with increasing temperature. These Ce3+ sites were primarily
	in the first layer based on the fact that exposure of the film to
	O2 at RT resulted in nearly complete conversion of Ce3+ to Ce4+.
	Annealing at 773 K led to a surface in which ≈40% of the surface
	Ce4+ sites were reduced to Ce3+, whereas annealing at higher temperatures
	led to more substantial reduction of the first layer along with some
	subsurface reduction that was not reoxidized by RT exposure to O2.
	Comparisons with results in the literature for reduction of single
	crystal CeO2(1 1 1) surfaces suggest that the volume-to-surface ratio
	of ceria samples influences, in part, the reduction conditions that
	result in detectable levels of surface Ce3+ sites. In other words,
	the annealing temperatures required to achieve a specific extent
	of surface reduction likely depends on the thickness of the sample.
	Water TPD studies on the oxidized CeO2(1 1 1) surface reveal strong
	coverage dependence that destabilizes high coverages of water relative
	to low coverages. The presence of surface reduction (on the order
	30% oxygen vacancy sites) removes much of the coverage dependent
	behavior. TPD uptake measurements, H2 TPD spectra and XPS spectra
	in the Ce3d core level and Ce4f valence band (VB) regions all indicate
	that little or no irreversible water decomposition or Ce3+ oxidation
	was observed for water on this reduced surface. In contrast, exposure
	of water at 650 K resulted in additional surface reduction above
	that observed from annealing at 650 K in the absence of water. This
	is attributed to a redistribution of oxygen vacancies from the bulk
	to the surface as a result of high temperature water treatment. Because
	water oxidation of Ce3+ surface sites has been observed for reduced
	ceria powders, but was not observed on the reduced CeO2(1 1 1) surfaces
	studied here, we propose that the reduced (1 1 1) surface is more
	resistant than non-(1 1 1) terminations to being oxidized by water.},

	in the soft-particle limit the local structure is dominated by the
	lengthscale associated with the average nearest neighbour distance
	of a random structure, which is --1/3 and increasingly only very weakly
	dependent on n. This scaling is also manifest in the behaviour of
	the average energy per particle with density. The self-diffusion
	coefficient and shear viscosity are computed along the fluid--solid

	Ds steadily increases with softness for n < 10, whereas the modified

	This is consistent with our observation that the static properties

	Abstract = {The pressure-induced structural transition in amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles
	has been studied in a spherical model of different diameters of 2,
	3 and 4 nm under non-periodic boundary conditions. We use the pairwise
	interatomic potentials proposed by Matsui and Akaogi. Models have
	been compressed from 3.8 g cm-3 up to very high density (i.e. high
	pressure) in order to investigate the pressure-induced structural
	changes. We found the change from the low-density amorphous (lda)
	form with ZTi--O ≈ 6.0 to the high-density amorphous (hda) one with
	ZTi--O ≈ 7.0 to be like those observed in practice. We found that
	the transition pressure is nanoparticle size dependent due to the
	surface effects. In order to compare and highlight the features of
	such transition in nanoparticles, we also present the results for
	the same transition in the amorphous TiO2 models containing 3000
	atoms under periodic boundary conditions, which could be considered
	as bulk counterparts. Structural properties of nanoparticles at 700
	K have been analysed in detail through the partial radial distribution
	functions, interatomic distances, coordination number and bond-angle
	distributions. Moreover, we also show the radial density profile
	in nanoparticles.},

	While previous proposals consider rutile as a passive electron sink
	hindering recombination in anatase, this research details the critical
	and active role of rutile in TiO2 formulations. The inactivity of
	pure-phase rutile is due in part to rapid rates of recombination.
	Yet, in mixed-phase TiO2, charges produced on rutile by visible light
	are stabilized through electron transfer to lower energy anatase

	transfer from rutile to anatase. Thus, rutile acts as an antenna

	Abstract = {Transport of conduction electrons and holes through the lattice of
	alpha-Fe2O3 (hematite) is modeled as a valence alternation of iron
	cations using ab initio electronic structure calculations and electron
	transfer theory. Experimental studies have shown that the conductivity
	along the (001) basal plane is four orders of magnitude larger than
	the conductivity along the [001] direction. In the context of the
	small polaron model, a cluster approach was used to compute quantities
	controlling the mobility of localized electrons and holes, i.e.,
	the reorganization energy and the electronic coupling matrix element
	that enter Marcus' theory. The calculation of the electronic coupling
	followed the generalized Mulliken--Hush approach using the complete
	active space self-consistent field method. Our findings demonstrate
	an approximately three orders of magnitude anisotropy in both electron
	and hole mobility between directions perpendicular and parallel to
	the c axis, in good accord with experimental data. The anisotropy
	arises from the slowness of both electron and hole mobilities across
	basal oxygen planes relative to that within iron bilayers between
	basal oxygen planes. Interestingly, for elementary reaction steps
	along either of the directions considered, there is only less than
	one order of magnitude difference in mobility between electrons and
	holes, in contrast to accepted classical arguments. Our findings
	indicate that the most important quantity underlying mobility differences
	is the electronic coupling, albeit the reorganization energy contributes
	as well. The large values computed for the electronic coupling suggest
	that charge transport reactions in hematite are adiabatic in nature.
	The electronic coupling is found to depend on both the superexchange
	interaction through the bridging oxygen atoms and the d-shell electron
	spin coupling within the Fe--Fe donor-acceptor pair, while the reorganization
	energy is essentially independent of the electron spin coupling.},

	Abstract = {We have performed a comprehensive first-principles investigation of
	native point defects in ZnO based on density functional theory within
	the local density approximation (LDA) as well as the LDA+U approach
	for overcoming the band-gap problem. Oxygen deficiency, manifested
	in the form of oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials, has long
	been invoked as the source of the commonly observed unintentional
	n-type conductivity in ZnO. However, contrary to the conventional
	wisdom, we find that native point defects are very unlikely to be
	the cause of unintentional n-type conductivity. Oxygen vacancies,
	which have most often been cited as the cause of unintentional doping,
	are deep rather than shallow donors and have high formation energies
	in n-type ZnO (and are therefore unlikely to form). Zinc interstitials
	are shallow donors, but they also have high formation energies in
	n-type ZnO and are fast diffusers with migration barriers as low
	as 0.57 eV; they are therefore unlikely to be stable. Zinc antisites
	are also shallow donors but their high formation energies (even in
	Zn-rich conditions) render them unlikely to be stable under equilibrium
	conditions. We have, however, identified a different low-energy atomic
	configuration for zinc antisites that may play a role under nonequilibrium
	conditions such as irradiation. Zinc vacancies are deep acceptors
	and probably related to the frequently observed green luminescence;
	they act as compensating centers in n-type ZnO. Oxygen interstitials
	have high formation energies; they can occur as electrically neutral
	split interstitials in semi-insulating and p-type materials or as
	deep acceptors at octahedral interstitial sites in n-type ZnO. Oxygen
	antisites have very high formation energies and are unlikely to exist
	in measurable concentrations under equilibrium conditions. Based
	on our results for migration energy barriers, we calculate activation
	energies for self-diffusion and estimate defect-annealing temperatures.
	Our results provide a guide to more refined experimental studies
	of point defects in ZnO and their influence on the control of p-type

	Abstract = {A combined experimental and theoretical/band structure investigation
	is reported of Ga-doped CdO (CGO) and In-doped CdO (CIO) thin films
	grown on both amorphous glass and single-crystal MgO(100) substrates
	at 410 $\,^{\circ}$C by metal--organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Film
	phase structure, microstructure, and electrical and optical properties
	are systematically investigated as a function of doping stoichiometry
	and growth conditions. XRD data reveal that all as-deposited CGO
	and CIO thin films are phase-pure and polycrystalline, with features
	assignable to a cubic CdO-type crystal structure. Epitaxial films
	grown on single-crystal MgO(100) exhibit biaxial, highly textured
	microstructures. These as-deposited CGO and CIO thin films exhibit
	excellent optical transparency, with an average transmittance of
	>80% in the visible range. Ga and In doping widens the optical band
	gap from 2.85 to 3.08 and 3.18 eV, respectively, via a Burstein--Moss
	shift. On MgO(100), room temperature thin film conductivities of
	11 500 and 20 000 S/cm are obtained at an optimum Ga and In doping
	levels of 1.6% and 2.6%, respectively. Together, the experimental
	and theoretical results reveal that dopant ionic radius and electronic
	configuration have a significant influence on the CdO-based TCO structural,
	electronic, and optical properties: (1) lattice parameters contract
	as a function of dopant ionic radius in the order Y (1.09 {\AA}) < In
	(0.94 {\AA}) < Sc (0.89 {\AA}), Ga (0.76 {\AA}), with the smallest radius ion
	among the four dopants only shrinking the lattice marginally and
	exhibiting low doping efficiency; (2) carrier mobilities and doping
	efficiencies decrease in the order In > Y > Sc > Ga; (3) the Sc and
	Y dopant d states have substantial influence on the position and
	width of the s-based conduction band, which ultimately determines
	the intrinsic charge transport characteristics.},

	Abstract = {The derivation of atomistic potential parameters, based on electronic
	structure calculations, for modeling electron and hole polarons in
	titania polymorphs is presented. The potential model is a polarizable
	version of the Matsui and Akaogi model (Matsui, M.; Akaogi, M. Mol.
	Simul. 1991, 6, 239) that makes use of a shell model to account for
	the polarizability of oxygen ions. The −1 and +1 formal charges of
	the electron and hole polarons, respectively, are modeled by delocalizing
	the polaron's charge over a titanium or oxygen ion, respectively,
	and its first nearest-neighbors. The charge distributions and the
	oxygen polarizability were fitted to the reorganization energies
	of a series of electron and hole polaron transfers in rutile and
	anatase obtained from electronic structure calculations at zero Kelvin
	and validated against lattice deformation due to both types of polaron.
	Good agreement was achieved for both properties. In addition, the
	potential model yields an accurate representation of a range of bulk
	properties of several TiO2 polymorphs as well as Ti2O3. The model
	thus derived enables us to consider systems large enough to investigate
	how the charge transfer properties at titania surfaces and interfaces
	differ from those in the bulk. For example, reorganization energies
	and free energies of charge transfer were computed as a function
	of depth below vacuum-terminated rutile (110) and anatase (001) surfaces
	using a mapping approach first introduced by Warshel (Warshel, A.
	J. Phys. Chem. 1982, 86, 2218). These calculations indicate that
	deviations from bulk values at the surface are substantial but limited
	to the first couple of surface atomic layers and that polarons are

	Abstract = {A fcc oxygen defect pyrochlore structure system Lu2V2O7?x with x=0.40--0.65
	was synthesized from the known fcc ferromagnetic semiconductor pyrochlore
	compound Lu2V2O7 which can be written as Lu2V2O6' with two inequivalent
	oxygen sites O and O'. Rietveld x-ray diffraction refinements show
	significant Lu-V antisite disorder for x>~0.5. The lattice parameter
	versus x (including x=0) shows a distinct maximum at x~0.4. We propose
	that these observations can be explained if the oxygen defects are
	on the O[prime] sublattice of the structure. The magnetic susceptibility
	versus temperature exhibits Curie-Weiss behavior above 150 K for
	all x, with a Curie constant C that increases with x as expected
	in an ionic model. However, the magnetization measurements also show
	that the (ferromagnetic) Weiss temperature theta and the ferromagnetic
	ordering temperature TC both strongly decrease with increasing x
	instead of increasing as expected from C(x). The TC decreases from
	73 K for x=0 to 21 K for x=0.65. Furthermore, the saturation moment
	at a field of 5.5 T at 5 K is nearly independent of x, with the value
	expected for a fixed spin 1/2 per V. The latter three observations
	suggest that Lu2V2O7?x may contain localized spin 1/2 vanadium moments
	in a metallic background that is induced by oxygen defect doping,
	instead of being a semiconductor as suggested by the C(x) dependence.
	We present evidence of magnetic granularity in Lu2V2O7?x with increasing
	x, due to the random distribution of oxygen vacancies and associated
	Lu-V antisite mixing. For x=0.65, isothermal magnetization versus
	magnetic field M(H) and low-field M(T) measurements indicate the
	formation of interacting nanoscopic ferromagnetic domains below TC.},

	Abstract = {The initial stage of the pressure-induced, wurtzite-to-rocksalt phase
	transition in CdS was investigated using picosecond time-resolved
	electronic spectroscopy in plate impact shock wave experiments. Real-time
	changes in the electronic spectra were observed, with 100 ps time
	resolution, in single crystals of CdS shocked along the crystal a
	and c axes to peak stresses ranging between 35 and 90 kbar; these
	stresses are above the phase-transition threshold stress of approximately
	30 kbar. The changes observed suggest that, when shocked to sufficiently
	high stress, the crystal undergoes a very rapid (<100 ps) change
	in electronic structure from a direct band gap of 2.5 eV to an indirect
	band gap of 1.51$\pm$0.02 eV. This large change in the electronic structure
	indicates that significant changes in the crystal structure of CdS
	occur within the first 100 ps of the arrival of the shock wave at
	the sample. Combined with previous nanosecond continuum data, these
	results make a strong case for a metastable state during the phase
	transition in shocked CdS. Ab initio periodic Hartree-Fock (with
	density-functional correlation corrections) total-energy, electronic
	structure, and density-of-states calculations were employed to determine
	a possible lattice structure for the proposed metastable state. From

	Abstract = {The two polymorphs of TiO2, rutile and anatase, have been investigated
	at the ab initio level using different Hamiltonians with all-electron
	Gaussian and projector augmented plane wave basis sets. Their equilibrium
	lattice parameters, relative stabilities, binding energies, and band
	structures have been evaluated. The calculations have been performed
	at the Hartree-Fock, density functional theory (DFT), and hybrid
	(B3LYP and PBE0) levels. As regards DFT, the local density and generalized
	gradient (PBE) approximations have been used. Our results show an
	excellent agreement with the experimental band structures and binding
	energies for the B3LYP and PBE0 functionals, while the best structural
	descriptions are obtained at the PBE0 level. However, no matter which
	Hamiltonian and method are used, anatase is found more stable than
	rutile, in contrast with recent experimental reports, although the
	relative stabilities of the two phases are very close to each other.
	Nevertheless, based on the overall results, the hybrid PBE0 functional
	appears as a good compromise to obtain an accurate description of
	both structural and electronic properties of solids.},

	have been considered on slabs. Even if the presence of atomic hydrogen
	on the surface does not arise from the H2 dissociation, we will refer
	to the H--H cleavage for the analysis. Hence, in the H mode, the heterolytic
	cleavage of H2 yields to H+ and H−. The proton interacts with the
	most basic oxygen atoms of the surface, while H− adsorbs on a metal
	cation which is the Lewis acidic site. In the R mode, two H+ fix
	on top of the outer surface anions and two Ti(IV) are reduced to
	Ti(III). Our calculated adsorption energies values show that the
	R mode is the most favorable. The surface reduction is only apparent
	through the spin polarization and does not lead to a full electron
	charge transfer from the hydrogen atoms to the surface. The change
	of the electronic state and of the adsorption strength with the slab
	thickness is presented. Using NH3 as a probe molecule to test the

	Surface relaxation significantly contributes to increase the adsorption
	strengths; however it does not modify the qualitative conclusions.},

	For example, the addition of 20 mol % Ti into V2O5 polycrystalline
	demonstrated an approximated 100% improvement in Li+ intercalation
	performance as compared to single V2O5 electrodes. Such enhancement
	in intercalation properties of V2O5 films with TiO2 addition was
	attributed to changes in microstructure, crystallinity, and also
	a possible lattice structure and interaction force between adjacent

	Abstract = {Monodispersed copper sulfide nanocrystals were synthesized via the
	decomposition of an air-stable precursor, copper (I) thiobenzoate
	(CuTB), in the presence of dodecanethiol (DDT). We discover that,
	by varying the stabilizing agent used (trioctylphosphine or tributylphosphite),
	we can selectively generate phase-pure roxbyite nanoplates (Cu1.75S)
	or chalcocite faceted nanocrystals (Cu2S). We also demonstrate that,
	under suitable conditions, the roxbyite nanoplates can be forced
	to grow only in two dimensions, with an aspect ratio (diameter/thickness)
	tunable between 2.3 and 4.1. To the best of our knowledge, this is
	the first report for making nanocrystalline copper sulfide with such
	aspect ratio tunability. Temperature and the [DDT]/[CuTB] ratio were
	identified to be the important factors for controlling the size of
	the nanocrystals. To gain more insight to the mechanisms of phase-selective
	control, we attempted a series of controlled experiments and DFT
	calculations. It appears that the precursor can undergo two competitive
	pathways, leading to seeds, and thus the growth, of different crystal
	phases. This work thus demonstrates a general approach to phase-selective
	nanocrystals engineering whereby the kinetics of decomposition of
	a chosen precursor is readily manipulated using activating or stabilizing

	Conditions for the absolute convergence of the total energy in periodic

	to converge as O(L-5) where L is the linear dimension of the supercell.
	For charged systems, convergence at this rate can be achieved after

	Data were obtained on samples in the "as grown" state, as well as
	on crystals which were thermally equilibrated in oxygen. A single-donor-level
	analysis on heat-treated crystals with donor concentrations (ND)
	between 1×1016 and 5×1017 cm-3 resulted in values of the "density-of-states"
	effective mass m(N)=0.22m. Values of the donor ionization energy
	ED were found to decrease with increasing ND. At infinite dilution
	ED has an estimated value of 0.15 eV. Room-temperature thermoelectric-power
	measurements resulted in calculated values of m(N) between 0.12 and
	0.18m. Antimony-doped crystals of SnO2 with ND>6×1018 cm-3 appeared
	to be degenerate above 80$\,^{\circ}$K. The low-temperature Hall mobility was
	found to decrease with decreasing donor concentration. A qualitative
	treatment of the data appears consistent with the hypothesis of impurity-level
	transport. Mobility above 300$\,^{\circ}$K was analyzed by considering polar-optical

	Abstract = {The electronic structure of surface defects on NiO(100) and their
	interaction with O2 and H2O have been studied on single crystals
	cleaved in ultrahigh vacuum by using ultraviolet and x-ray photoemission
	and Auger spectroscopies, as well as low-energy-electron diffraction.
	Defects created by inert ion bombardment of the NiO(100) surface
	are associated with anion vacancies. These result in Fs centers when
	isolated, and in the formation of a 1.5-eV-wide surface conduction
	band as the defect density increases. The satellites, which appear
	at approximately 7 eV from each of the Ni photoemission peaks in
	NiO, decrease in amplitude as the density of anion vacancies increases.
	This result is in agreement with the identification of these satellites
	as resulting from unscreened emission. Oxygen does not interact with
	the perfect surface, but for small exposures it chemisorbs dissociatively
	at defect sites, rapidly depopulating the band-gap states associated
	with the defects. This phase of adsorption is essentially complete
	after 10 L of exposure (1 L = 1 langmuir≡10-6 Torr sec). A second
	phase having a small sticking coefficient continues to adsorb up
	to O2 exposures of 109 L. The photoemission spectra of this second
	phase differ distinctly from those of both lattice oxygen and molecular
	O2, and we tentatively identify this phase as O2 2-. This assignment
	is compatible with previous interpretations of intermediate phases
	of oxygen adsorption on metals at low temperatures and with electron-energy-loss
	data from other oxides. H2O adsorption on NiO takes place only in
	the presence of nonlattice oxygen. The resultant adsorption is dissociative,
	leading to the formation of OH- radicals on the surface.},

	Abstract = {Molecular adsorption of formaldehyde on the stoichiometric CeO2(111)
	and CeO2(110) surfaces was studied using periodic density functional
	theory. Two adsorption modes (strong chemisorbed and weak physisorbed)
	were identified on both surfaces. This is consistent with recent
	experimental observations. On the (111) surface, formaldehyde strongly
	chemisorbs with an adsorption energy of 0.86 eV to form a dioxymethylene-like
	structure, in which a surface O lifts from the surface to bind with
	the C of formaldehyde. A weak physisorbed state with adsorption energy
	of 0.28 eV was found with the O of formaldehyde interacting with
	a surface Ce. On the (110) surface, dioxymethyelene formation was
	also observed, with an adsorption energy of 1.31 eV. The weakly adsorbed
	state of formaldehyde on the (110) surface was energetically comparable
	to the weak adsorption state on the (111) surface. Analysis of the
	local density of states and charge density differences after adsorption
	shows that strong covalent bonding occurs between the C of formaldehyde
	and surface O when dioxymethylene forms. Calculated vibrational frequencies
	also confirm dioxymethylene formation. Our results show that as the
	coverage increases, the adsorption of formaldehyde on the (111) surface
	becomes weak, but is nearly unaffected on the (110) surface.},

	trend is a decrease of the heat of adsorption on the metal cations.
	The reactivity decreases at sites in the vicinity of the defects
	due to the reduction induced by the O vacancies. At the defect site
	the decrease is less pronounced for H, H2, CO and molecular H2O.
	In the case of H2O dissociative adsorption, the defect site is more
	reactive than the perfect surface. Thus, a hydration converting the
	defective-reduced TiO2 to the hydrogenated non-defective-reduced
	surface is easy. The resulting structure possesses surface hydroxyl

	Abstract = {Experimental and computational studies were performed to investigate
	the electronic structure of main group oxides containing edge-sharing
	octahedra. Compounds belonging to four structure types were investigated:
	rutile (SnO2, PbO2), trirutile (MgSb2O6, ZnSb2O6, MgBi2O6, ZnBi2O6),
	PbSb2O6-type (CdSb2O6, CaSb2O6, SrSb2O6, BaSb2O6, SrBi2O6, BaBi2O6),
	and ilmenite (ZnSnO3, CdSnO3, CaSnO3, NaSbO3, KSbO3, NaBiO3, AgBiO3).
	For application as an n-type transparent conductor, the conduction
	band (CB) properties are of primary importance. In all compounds
	investigated here, the CB arises primarily from the antibonding M
	ns to O 2p interaction (M = Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi). To be an effective transparent
	conductor the lowest energy band in the CB should be wide so that
	carriers introduced upon doping will be highly mobile. For this to
	occur, the antibonding M ns to O 2p interactions must be offset by
	a bonding interaction at the CB minimum (normally at the point).
	In ternary oxides, the bonding interaction involves overlap between
	the empty valence shell s orbital on the charge compensating A cation
	(A = Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Na+, K+, Ag+, Cd2+, Zn2+) with unfilled
	antibonding states originating on the edge-sharing octahedral framework.
	A disperse CB is obtained when the electronegativity of the A cation
	is such that it enables a covalent interaction with oxygen, and the
	oxygen coordination environment is symmetric. These conditions are
	met in ZnSb2O6 (trirutile), CdSb2O6 (PbSb2O6-type), CdSnO3 (ilmenite),
	ZnSnO3 (ilmenite), and AgBiO3 (ilmenite), as well as the binary oxides
	SnO2 and In2O3 (corundum polymorph). When M is Bi5+ or Pb4+, relativistic
	effects reduce the spatial overlap between M 6s orbital and the oxygen
	orbitals. This effect lowers the energy of the conduction band, thereby
	narrowing the band gap. Consequently, in these materials, it is generally
	not possible to simultaneously obtain a disperse CB and a wide band
	gap, limiting applications as transparent conductors.},

	in the wurtzite (B4) structure were constructed with morphologies
	which minimize the surface energy. These were then embedded in a
	pressurization medium, consisting of a binary Lennard-Jones-type
	fluid and progressively pressurized in ``constant pressure'' molecular
	dynamics simulation runs. Phase transitions to the rocksalt (B1)
	phase were confirmed by examining calculated powder diffraction patterns,
	which show the same changes in features as seen for experimental
	systems. By directly observing the atomic trajectories throughout
	the duration of the transition the local mechanism has been identified.
	The transition proceeds via a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate,
	denoted as the h-MgO structure. It is initiated by a single nucleation
	event at a $[11\bar{2}0]_\mathrm{B4}$ surface with subsequent growth
	of the B1 region throughout the remainder of the nanocrystal. The
	consequences of this mechanism for the particle shape of the product
	phase are detailed and contrasted with those previously found for
	initially zincblende (B3) structured nanoparticles, using the same
	interaction potential. The observed transition pressures are elevated
	relative to the thermodynamically predicted pressure for the bulk,
	but there is no observable system size effect on the transition pressure
	across the size range of nanocrystals investigated.},

	Abstract = {Experimental observations indicate that removing bridging oxygen atoms
	from the TiO2 rutile (110) surface produces a localized state approximately
	0.7 eV below the conduction band. The corresponding excess electron
	density is thought to localise on the pair of Ti atoms neighbouring
	the vacancy; formally giving two Ti3+ sites. We consider the electronic
	structure and geometry of the oxygen deficient TiO2 rutile (110)
	surface using both gradient-corrected density functional theory (GGA
	DFT) and DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (GGA+U) to
	allow a direct comparison of the two methods. We show that GGA fails
	to predict the experimentally observed electronic structure, in agreement
	with previous uncorrected DFT calculations on this system. Introducing
	the +U term encourages localisation
	
	of the excess electronic charge, with the qualitative distribution
	depending on the value of U. For low values of U (? 4.0 eV) the charge
	localises in the sub-surface layers occupied in the GGA solution
	at arbitrary Ti sites, whereas higher values of U (? 4.2 eV) predict
	strong localisation with the excess electronic charge mainly on the

	Abstract = {High-resolution core- and valence-level photoemission spectra of Nb-doped
	TiO2 ceramics (Ti1-xNbxO2 with 0.01<x<0.8) have been measured using
	monochromatic x-ray excitation. Nb doping produces a well-defined
	photoemission peak in the bulk band gap of rutile, whose intensity
	increases with increasing doping level. Core-level spectroscopy shows
	that the Nb is incorporated within the rutile lattice at low doping
	levels mainly as Nb(V) and that the gap state is associated with
	Ti(III) ions. This conclusion is reinforced by variable energy photoemission
	measurements on Ti0.9Nb0.1O2 in the vicinity of the Ti 3p and Nb
	4p core thresholds. The photoemission resonance profile for the gap
	states reaches half maximum intensity at the same energy as found
	for oxygen-deficient TiO2-x but is shifted from the resonance profile
	for the Nb 4d states of NbO2. STM images on Nb-doped TiO2(110) are
	considered in relation to the spectroscopic measurements. Nb dopant
	atoms are imaged as ``bright spot'' clusters, implying delocalization
	of charge from Nb onto neighboring Ti ions. The experimental x-ray
	photoelectron spectroscopy data are compared with density-of-states
	profiles derived from local-density approximation calculations on
	pure and Nb-doped TiO2 clusters. These calculations show that Nb
	doping of TiO2 introduces new states of mixed Nb 4d--Ti 3d character
	above the O 2p valence band of the host material. In addition, there
	is increased x-ray photoemission intensity across the O 2p valence
	band owing to strong Nb 4d/O 2p hybridization and a cross section
	for ionization of Nb 4d states that is an order of magnitude larger
	than that for O 2p or Ti 3d states.},

	Abstract = {Conventional density functional theory (DFT) fails for materials with
	strongly correlated electrons, such as late transition metal oxides.
	Large errors in the intra-atomic Coulomb and exchange interactions
	are the source of this failure. The DFT+U method has provided a means,
	through empirical parameters, to correct these errors. Here, we present
	a systematic ab initio approach in evaluating the intra-atomic Coulomb
	and exchange terms, U and J, respectively, in order to make the DFT+U
	method a fully first-principles technique. The method is based on
	a relationship between these terms and the Coulomb and exchange integrals
	evaluated in the basis of unrestricted Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals
	that represent localized states of the extended system. We used this
	ab initio scheme to evaluate U and J for chromia (Cr2O3). The resulting
	values are somewhat higher than those determined earlier either empirically
	or in constrained DFT calculations but have the advantage of originating
	from an ab initio theory containing exact exchange. Subsequent DFT+U
	calculations on chromia using the ab initio derived U and J yield
	properties consistent with experiment, unlike conventional DFT. Overall,

	fluorite structures) have been carried out with the all-electron
	linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) and pseudopotential
	planewave (PW) methods. The anatase versus rutile relative phase
	stability at 0 K and zero pressure has been investigated using high-quality

	the optimal crystal structures obtained with the Hartree-Fock theory
	at various pressures, the bulk modulus and phase transition pressures
	of various high-pressure polymorphs have been derived at the athermal
	limit. In most cases, the calculated unit cell data agree to within
	2% of the corresponding experimental determination. Complete predicted
	structural data (unit cell constants and fractional atomic coordinates)
	are presented for the baddeleyite and pyrite forms. The calculated
	bulk moduli are within 10% of the most reliable experimental results.
	Both the all-electron LCAO and pseudopotential PW methods predict
	anatase to be more stable than rutile at 0 K and ambient pressure.
	The computed anatase-columbite, rutile-columbite, columbite-baddeleyite,
	and baddeleyite-cotunnite phase transitions appear in the same order
	as observed in experiments, and the transition pressures agree semiquantitatively
	with those measured. The pyrite and fluorite structures are predicted
	to be less stable than other polymorphs at pressures below 70 GPa
	in agreement with experiments. Finally, the elastic properties, compressibilities
	and phase transformations of the various polymorphs are discussed

	core corrections (NLCC). It has been found that the NLCC calculatinos
	provide a very good description of the structural parameters and
	the HP-SPT's of ZnS, provided that the Zn pseudopotential is generated
	from nonrelativistic atomic calculations. The cinnabar structure
	is found to be an intermediate phase between the ZB and the RS structures
	of ZnS, a behavior which was previously associated only with the

	Abstract = {Electron transport in porous, nanocrystalline metal oxide electrodes
	exhibits many features typical of dispersive transport in disordered
	semiconductors. This disorder can be attributed to energetic disorder
	in localized electron transport sites, or `trap' sites. A numerical
	model based upon the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) is introduced
	to describe electron dynamics. The model is applied primarily to
	explain the stretched-exponential kinetic shape and strong bias dependence
	of optically observed recombination of electrons with photo-oxidized
	dye molecules, with the conclusion that recombination is limited
	by electron diffusion through a distribution of trap states. Analogous
	experimental and modelling studies of the functionally important
	back reaction between electrons in the metal oxide and oxidized species
	in the redox couple indicate that this recombination pathway is also
	dominated by trap-limited electron diffusion. The model predicts
	that such dispersive charge transport should be observed only on
	time scales shorter than the release time from the deepest trap,
	and this feature is used to explain the transition from fast, dispersive
	recombination kinetics slow and monoexponential behaviour in the
	presence of a slow (>10 ms) process limiting interfacial electron
	transfer. It is shown how transient optical measurements combined
	with modelling can be used as a probe of local electron dynamics,
	using inter-particle electron transport as an example. Finally, the
	application of random walk methods to simulation of device current--voltage
	characteristics is discussed.},

	Abstract = {We use transient and steady-state optical spectroscopies to study
	the recombination reaction between electrons and dye cations in a
	dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode in several different
	chemical environments. Kinetic decay curves are approximately stretched
	exponential, and the cation half-life, t50% varies with electron
	density n as t50%∝n-1/α, where α is a constant in the range 0.2--0.5.
	We have developed a model of electron transport in the presence of
	an energetic distribution of trap states and consider two regimes.
	In the first, the continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) electrons are
	free to diffuse through the lattice, by means of multiple trapping
	events mediated by the conduction band. In the second, the hopping
	regime, trapped electrons are allowed to tunnel to other, vacant
	trap sites, or to the dye cation, according to a Miller-Abrahams
	model for the transition rate. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations
	of the recombination kinetics as a function of electron density,
	trap state distributions and other parameters. The CTRW reproduces
	both the dependence of t50% on n and the shape of the kinetic curves
	with only one free fitting parameter, for the case of an exponential
	density of trap states. The hopping model is ruled out by subnanosecond
	measurements. We conclude that multiple trapping with a broad energetic
	distribution of electron traps is responsible for the slow recombination
	kinetics. When applied to recombination in a nanocrystalline photovoltaic
	junction at open circuit, the model predicts a sublinear power-law
	variation of electron density with light intensity G, n∝Gα, compatible

	potential for low-cost, environmentally friendly solar-hydrogen production

	and the poor activation of TiO2 by visible light. In response to

	with an emphasis on effective remediation methods. Some investigators

	salts to prohibit rapid recombination of electron/hole pairs and
	backward reactions. Other research focused on the enhancement of
	photocatalysis by modification of TiO2 by means of metal loading,
	metal ion doping, dye sensitization, composite semiconductor, anion
	doping and metal ion-implantation. This paper aims to review the
	up-to-date development of the above-mentioned technologies applied

	approaches to unravel the details of the adsorption process and the

	The optimal value of U is 3 eV, determined from comparison of the

	are analysed by means of the electronic density of states and the
	electron density. We demonstrate that the bonding in pure ceria is
	partially covalent and analysis of the resulting electronic states
	confirms the presence of localised Ce4f states above the Fermi level.
	The surface atoms show only a small change in the charge distribution
	in comparison to the bulka nd from the DOS the main differences are
	due to the changes in the oxygen 2p and cerium 5 d states. Investigation
	of the
	
	atomic and electronic structure of an oxygen vacancy on the (10 0)
	surface shows the problems DFT can have with the description of strongly
	localised systems, wrongly predicting electron delocalisation over
	all of the cerium atoms in the simulation cell. We demonstrate an
	improvement in the description of the strongly correlated cerium
	4f states
	
	in partially reduced ceria by applying the DFT+U methodology, which
	leads to the appearance of a new gap state between the valence band
	and the empty Ce4f band. Analysis of the partial charge density shows
	that these states are localised on the CeIII ions neighbouring the
	oxygen vacancy. In terms of classical defect chemistry, the vacancy
	is bound by two neighbouring CeIII ions, which have been reduced
	from CeIV, i.e. $\mathrm{V}_\"{\mathrm{O}}+ 2\mathrm{Ce}\prime_\mathrm{Ce}$.
	The remaining Ce ions are in the CeIV oxidation state. The localisation
	of Ce4f electrons modifies the predicted structure of the defective
	surface.},

	Abstract = {Ceria, CeO2, plays an important role in catalysis, participating directly
	in the conversion of environmentally sensitive molecules. This arises
	from the ability of ceria to store and release oxygen depending upon
	the conditions present in the exhaust gas. Obtaining a basic understanding
	of oxygen vacancy defects in ceria and the interaction of defective
	structures with such molecules is central to our understanding of
	the role of ceria in catalysis. In this work we examine using first
	principles density functional theory (DFT), with the inclusion of
	on site electronic correlations (DFT + U), the geometry and electronic
	structure of (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) ceria surfaces that include
	oxygen vacancies. We find for all surfaces that the surface (atomistic)
	structure is strongly perturbed and the extraction of an oxygen vacancy
	is associated with a reduction of two neighbouring Ce(IV) species
	to Ce(III) rather than partial reduction of all Ce ions in the simulation
	cell. In the electronic density of states a new gap state appears
	between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the unoccupied
	Ce 4f states. Localisation of charge due to the gap state and excess
	spin density on Ce3+ sites neighbouring the vacancy is observed for
	all three surfaces. These DFT + U results are validated by recent
	experimental results regarding the electronic structure of reduced
	ceria surfaces, in contrast to previous DFT results. We observe an
	interesting result that the vacancy formation energies do not follow
	the same order as the stabilities of the pure surfaces, as measured
	by the surface energy; thus, the (1 1 0) surface has the lowest vacancy
	formation energy. The impact of this for the study of catalytic reactions
	on ceria surfaces is discussed.},

	We present the structure and energetics of CO adsorbed onto stoichiometric
	(111), (110), and (100) surfaces of ceria from first principles density
	functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT+U.
	DFT+U is applied because it can describe consistently the properties
	of both the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces. Our major finding
	is that the interaction is strongly surface dependent, consistent
	with experiment. Upon interaction of CO with the (111) surface, weak
	binding is found, with little perturbation to the surface or the
	molecule. For the (110) and (100) surfaces, the most stable adsorbate
	is that in which the CO molecule bridges two oxygen atoms and pulls
	these atoms out of their lattice sites, with formation of a (CO3)
	species. This results in a strong modification to the surface structure,
	consistent with that resulting from mild reduction. The electronic
	structure also demonstrates reduction of the ceria surface and consequent
	localization of charge on cerium atoms neighboring the vacancy sites.
	The surface-bound (CO3) species is identified as a carbonate, (CO3)2-
	group, which is formed along with two reduced surface Ce(III) ions,
	in good agreement with experimental infrared data. These results
	provide a detailed investigation of the interactions involved in

	Abstract = {Due to the well-known problem of the self-interaction, standard density
	functional theory (DFT) methods tend to produce delocalized holes
	and electrons in defective oxide materials even when there is ample
	experimental evidence of a strong localization. For late transition
	metal compounds or rare earth oxides, this results in the incorrect
	description of the electronic structure of the system (e.g., magnetic
	insulators are predicted to be metallic). Practical ways to correct
	this deficiency are based on the use of hybrid functionals or of
	the DFT+U approach. In this way, most of the limitations related
	to the self-interaction are removed, and the electronic structure
	is properly described. What is less clear is to what extent hybrid
	functionals, DFT+U approaches, or standard DFT functionals can properly
	describe the strength of the chemical bonds at the surface of an
	oxide. This is a crucial question if one is interested in the catalytic
	properties of oxide surfaces. Oxidation reactions often involve oxygen
	detachment from the surface and incorporation into an organic substrate.
	Oxides are doped with heteroatoms to create defects and facilitate
	oxygen removal from the surface, with formation of oxygen vacancies.
	Do standard DFT calculations provide a good binding energy of the
	missing oxygen despite the failure in giving the right electronic
	structure? Can hybrid functionals or the DFT+U approach provide a
	simple yet reliable way to get accurate reaction enthalpies and energy
	barriers? In this essay, we discuss these problems by analyzing some
	case histories and the relatively scarce data existing in the literature.
	The conclusion is that while modern electronic structure methods
	accurately reproduce and predict a wide range of electronic, optical,
	and magnetic properties of oxides, the description of the strength
	of chemical bonds still needs considerable improvements.},

	Abstract = {The ``classical'' model of the $[\mathrm{AlO}_4]^0$ defect center
	in irradiated quartz, an Al impurity having replaced a four-coordinated
	Si atom, is that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen
	atom, with consequent asymmetric relaxation along that particular
	Al--O direction. This model has been proposed years ago, based on
	the analysis of the electron-paramagnetic-resonance spectra of Al-containing
	crystalline SiO$_2$ and analysis of Hartree-Fock cluster model calculations.
	Three recent theoretical studies based on first-principle density-functional
	theory (DFT) and band-structure plane-wave calculations proposed
	an alternative model where the hole is completely delocalized over
	four oxygen neighbors to the Al impurity, at 0 K. Using cluster models
	containing as many as 104 Si and O atoms and various theoretical
	approaches, we show that the delocalized picture is an artifact of
	the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when
	an exact treatment of the exchange term is used. The validity of
	this conclusion is based on the direct comparison of computed and
	measured quantities such as the $^{17}$O hyperfine and $^{27}$Al,
	$^{29}$Si superhyperfine coupling parameters, the $^{27}$Al nuclear
	quadrupole effect, and the derivable local distortion around the

	Abstract = {We use density functional calculations to study the structure and
	the energy of formation of the surface oxygen vacancy (VO) in a free-standing,
	very-thin film (VTF) of ZnO and substitutionally doped ZnO VTF. We
	are interested in this system because the walls of very high area
	oxides used in catalysis contain VTFs. We find that the structure
	of the ZnO(000) VTF is strongly dependent on the film thickness.
	Decreasing the thickness of the ZnO(000) VTF increases the distances
	between the atomic planes along the (000) direction. At a film thickness
	of five layers (L), the energy of the VTF with a wurtzite structure
	is the same as the energy of the VTF with a hexagonal structure.
	For thickness <5 layers, the hexagonal VTF is more stable than the
	wurtzite VTF. The formation of VO is exothermic and leads to a decrease
	in the interplanar distance along the (000) direction in the entire
	film, making the structure close to that of wurtzite. The exothermic
	nature of VO formation suggests that the ZnO(000) VTF with vacancies
	is thermodynamically stable at low oxygen pressures in the gas phase.
	The structure of the ZnO(100) VTF does not depend strongly on the
	film thickness. The formation of a VO at the surface of the ZnO(100)
	VTF is endothermic and affects the film structure only in the vicinity
	of the VO. Replacement of some of the Zn atoms at the surface of
	the stoichiometric ZnO(000) VTF by a dopant (Au, Ag, Cu, Ga, or Al)
	decreases the interplanar distance along the (000) direction in the
	entire film, making its structure close to that of wurtzite. The
	formation of a VO at the surface of a doped VTF is endothermic and,
	therefore, the presence of the dopant stabilizes the stoichiometric
	wurtzite structure. Doping the surface of the ZnO(100) VTF with Au,
	Ag, or Cu lowers the energy of VO formation at the surface and doping
	with Ga or Al increases it. We also find that Au, Ag, and Cu, which
	facilitate VO formation, segregate to the surface of the ZnO (100)
	VTF and Ga and Al, which hinder VO formation, segregate to the bulk.},

	Abstract = {XPS and periodic DFT calculations have been used to investigate water
	sorption on the TiO2 rutile (110) face. Two sets of XPS spectra were
	collected on the TiO2 (110) single crystal clean and previously exposed
	to water: the first set with photoelectrons collected in a direction
	parallel to the normal to the surface; and the second set with the
	sample tilted by 70 degrees, respectively. This tilting procedure
	promotes the signals from surface species and reveals that the first
	hydration layer is strongly coordinated to the surface and also that,
	despite the fact that the spectra were recorded under ultra-high
	vacuum, water molecules subsist in upper hydration layers. In addition,
	periodic DFT calculations were performed to investigate the water
	adsorption process to determine if molecular and/or dissociative
	adsorption takes place. The first step of the theoretical part was
	the optimisation of a dry surface model and then the investigation
	of water adsorption. The calculated molecular water adsorption energies
	are consistent with previously published experimental data and it
	appears that even though it is slightly less stable, the dissociative
	water sorption can also take place. This assumption was considered,
	in a second step, on a larger surface model where molecular and dissociated
	water molecules were adsorbed together with different ratio. It was
	found that, due to hydrogen bonding stabilisation, molecular and
	dissociated water molecules can coexist on the surface if the ratio
	of dissociated water molecules is less than approximate to 33%. These
	results are consistent with previous experimental works giving a

@article{PerssonEtAl_PhysRevB2005,
	Abstract = {The efficiency of CuInSe2 based solar cell devices could improve significantly
	if CuGaSe2, a wider band gap chalcopyrite semiconductor, could be
	added to the CuInSe2 absorber layer. This is, however, limited by
	the difficulty of doping n-type CuGaSe2 and, hence, in its alloys
	with CuInSe2. Indeed, wider-gap members of semiconductor series are
	often more difficult to dope than lower-gap members of the same series.
	We find that in chalcopyrites, there are three critical values of
	the Fermi energy EF that control n-type doping: (i) EF n,pin is the
	value of EF where the energy to form Cu vacancies is zero. At this
	point, the spontaneously formed vacancies (=acceptors) kill all electrons.
	(ii) EF n,comp is the value of EF where the energy to form a Cu vacancy
	equals the energy to form an n-type dopant, e.g., CdCu. (iii) EF
	n,site is the value of EF where the formation of Cd-on-In is equal
	to the formation of Cd-on-Cu. For good n-type doping, EF n,pin, EF
	n,comp, and EF n,site need to be
	
	as high as possible in the gap. We find that these quantities are
	higher in the gap in CuInSe2 than in CuGaSe2, so the latter is difficult
	to dope n-type. In this work, we calculate all three critical Fermi
	energies and study theoretically the best growth condition for n-type
	CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 with possible cation and anion doping.
	
	We find that the intrinsic defects such as VCu and InCu or GaCu play
	significant roles in doping in both chalcopyrites. For group-II cation
	(Cd, Zn, or Mg) doping, the best n-type growth condition is In/Ga-rich,
	and maximal Se-poor, which is also the optimal condition for stabilizing
	the intrinsic InCu/GaCu donors. Bulk CuInSe2 can be doped at equilibrium
	n-type, but bulk CuGaSe2 cannot be due to the low formation energy
	of intrinsic Cu-vacancy. For halogen anion doping, the best n-type
	materials growth is still under In/ Ga-rich, and maximal Se-poor
	conditions. These conditions are not best for halogen substitutional
	defects, but are optimal for intrinsic InCu/GaCu donors. Again, CuGaSe2
	cannot be doped n-type by halogen doping, while CuInSe2 can.},

	formation of tetraoxygen (O4) anchored at the vacancy site, which
	in turn allows adsorption of three O2 molecules per vacancy in saturation
	coverage. We present the structure, bonding, and energetics of adsorbed
	oxygen species by changing the number of adsorbed oxygen molecules
	per vacancy. We also find that thermally activated O2 desorption
	may take place via two channels that require overcoming barriers
	of 0.41 and 1.25 eV, respectively. In addition, our study provides
	strong theoretical evidence for the change in O2 reactivity with
	O2 coverage. Our findings associated with tetraoxygen complexes are

	Abstract = {Novel defect-free (TiO2)n nanoparticles can be very useful for mechanistic
	studies of photooxidation of water and organic pollutants on nanostructured
	oxide materials involving surface-trapped electrons and holes. In
	this study, the electronic structure and stability of (TiO2)n nanoparticles
	with n = 10-16 (~1 nm in diameter) have been investigated using the
	density functional B3LYP/LANL2DZ method to find stable, Ti=O defect-free
	structures. The even-n (TiO2)n clusters tend to form compact (rather
	than linear or cyclic) covalent networks consisting of only 4-coordinated
	Ti(4) and 2-coordinated O(2) atoms, while odd-n clusters tend to
	form more ionic structures with additional highly coordinated Ti
	and O atoms. The new half-spherical (TiO2)15 15b cluster represents
	the smallest defect-free rutile nanocrystal. Strong vibrational bands
	around 770 and 820 cm-1 are found to be useful for identifying surface
	O(2) and O(3) species, respectively. Consistent with the odd-even
	oscillation of structural features of stable (TiO2)n nanoparticles,
	various electronic properties, including cluster formation energies,
	HOMO-LUMO gaps, vertical excitation energies, and ionization potentials,
	also show odd-even oscillations. Strong interatomic O(2p) lone pair
	interactions that destabilize the highest occupied molecular orbitals
	of the (TiO2)n clusters can significantly reduce the lowest vertical
	excitation energy to values significantly below the band gap of bulk
	TiO2 for clusters with odd n. If materials can be engineered to incorporate
	such (TiO2)n nanoparticles, they could exhibit visible light photoactivity.
	The electron holes are shown to be localized mainly on surface O(1)
	and O(2) rather than O(3) sites, suggesting that a recently proposed
	water photooxidation mechanism [Nakamura et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc.
	2005, 127, 12975] should be revised.},

	bond. The processes of O$_2$ diffusion from a vacancy to a trough

	Abstract = {In this work we report on theoretical calculations of methanol adsorption
	and dissociation on the stoichiometric and defective TiO2(110) surface.
	The periodic implementation of density functional theory (DFT) with
	plane waves and pseudopotentials was employed. A supercell made of
	4 × 1 unit cells was used to represent the surface, which corresponds
	to methanol coverage of 0.25 ML. The defective surface was modeled
	by removing one bridging oxygen from the outermost layer. Several
	adsorption sites were explored through both static and molecular
	dynamics calculations. The most stable adsorption site on the defective
	surface is with the molecule directly adsorbed onto the vacancy,
	whereas adsorption on titania resembles the stoichiometric case.
	Our estimated adsorption energies are found to be in agreement with
	the features observed in previous experimental desorption data. One
	of the main aims of this study was to determine whether methanol
	could dissociate on the stoichiometric surface. From static calculations
	we find that both the molecular and the dissociated state are almost
	degenerate. In addition, molecular dynamics calculations show that
	the transition barrier between the two species is small. On the other
	hand, dissociation on defects is thermodynamically favorable by 0.5
	eV. However, dynamic calculations show that in this case the conversion
	from the molecular to the dissociated state is not straightforward.
	Implications to these findings are discussed within the text.},

	Abstract = {Ceria, CeO2, based materials are a major (active) component of exhaust
	catalysts and promising candidates for solid oxide fuel cells. In
	this capacity, oxygen transport through the material is pivotal.
	Here, we explore whether oxygen transport is influenced (desirably
	increased) compared with transport within the bulk parent material
	by traversing to the nanoscale. In particular, atomistic models for
	ceria nanocrystals, including perfect: CeO2; reduced: CeO1.95 and
	doped: Rh0.1Ce0.9O1.95, have been generated. The nanocrystals were
	about 8 nm in diameter and each comprised about 16 000 atoms. Oxygen
	transport can also be influenced, sometimes profoundly, by microstructural
	features such as dislocations and grain-boundaries. However, these
	are difficult to generate within an atomistic model using, for example,
	symmetry operations. Accordingly, we crystallised the nanocrystals
	from an amorphous precursor, which facilitated the evolution of a
	variety of microstructures including: twin-boundaries and more general
	grain-boundaries and grain-junctions, dislocations and epitaxy, isolated
	and associated point defects. The shapes of the nanocrystals are
	in accord with HRTEM data and comprise octahedral morphologies with
	{111} surfaces, truncated by (dipolar) {100} surfaces together with
	a complex array of steps, edges and corners. Oxygen transport data
	was then calculated using these models and compared with data calculated
	previously for CeO1.97/YSZ thin films and the (bulk) parent material,
	CeO1.97. Oxygen transport was calculated to increase in the order:
	CeO2 nanocrystal < (reduced) CeO1.95 nanocrystal Rh0.1Ce0.9O1.95
	nanocrystal < CeO1.97/YSZ thin film < (reduced) CeO1.97 (bulk) parent
	material; the mechanism was determined to be primarily vacancy driven.
	Our findings indicate that reducing one- (thin film) or especially
	three- (nanocrystal) dimensions to the nanoscale may prove deleterious
	to oxygen transport. Conversely, we observed dynamic evolution and
	annihilation of surface vacancies via surface oxygens migrating to
	the bulk of the nanocrystal; the vacancies left are then filled by
	other oxygens moving to the surface. Coupled with previous simulation
	studies, in which we calculated that oxygen extraction from the surface
	of a ceria nanocrystal was energetically easier compared with the
	bulk surface, our calculations predict that ceria nanocrystals would
	facilitate effective oxidative catalysis. This study describes framework
	simulation procedures, which can be used in partnership with experiment,
	to explore transport in nanocrystalline ionic systems, which include
	complex microstructures. Such data can provide predictions for experiment
	or help reduce the number of experiments required.},

	Abstract = {Two methods of reduction of V2O5 have been investigated: oxygen vacancy

	in bulk α-V2O5 have been investigated by using gradient-corrected

	The GGA calculation predicts a delocalized defect electronic state.
	This disagrees with experimental evidence, which indicates that oxygen
	vacancies produce a localized reduced vanadium state in the band
	gap. The DFT+U results for U = 4.0 eV are consistent with available
	UPS and XPS data, indicating strong localization on the vanadium
	atoms nearest the vacancy, and showing reduced V(IV) species. Intercalation
	of Li in V2O5, which has important potential applications in energy
	storage devices, is also reported at the GGA+U level, using the value
	of U obtained from the oxygen-deficient calculation, and localized

	Abstract = {We report ab initio calculations of the surface electronic structure
	of the hexagonal wurtzite semiconductors ZnO and CdS. The calculations
	are carried out self-consistently in the local-density approximation
	employing separable norm-conserving pseudopotentials. Localized Gaussian
	orbitals are used in the basis set for an efficient description of
	the strongly localized wave functions. The Zn 3d and Cd 4d electrons
	are explicitly taken into account as valence electrons since they
	are important for a quantitative description of the structural as
	well as the electronic properties, as our investigations of bulk
	ZnO and CdS have shown. Cationic d-d repulsion, p-d and s-d interactions,
	and orthogonalization effects are, therefore, included in our calculations
	of the ZnO and CdS (101¯0) surfaces. The nonpolar cleavage face is
	described in a supercell geometry with eight atomic and four vacuum
	layers in each cell. The surface atomic structure is determined by
	elimination of the forces. For ZnO, we find a rotation relaxation,
	in which both the Zn and O surface atoms move inward towards the
	substrate. The calculated surface-perpendicular displacements of
	the Zn atoms relative to the O atoms in the top layer turn out to
	be slightly smaller than those determined experimentally by low-energy
	electron diffraction. The surface electronic structure exhibits an
	oxygen-derived dangling-bond band in the fundamental gap which is
	essentially unaffected by the calculated surface relaxation.
	
	
	This is in marked contrast to the results of previous studies using
	an empirical tight-binding approach which either find no surface
	states in the gap at all or one band of surface states that is shifted
	down into the projected bulk valence bands by the surface relaxation.
	For CdS(101¯0) we find a surface structure that nicely agrees in
	general with the relaxation model experimentally determined for the
	related CdSe(101¯0) surface. The surface electronic structure is
	compared with the results of polarization- and angle-resolved photoemission
	experiments. With the help of selection rules we are able to identify
	two occupied surface states at the top of the projected bulk valence
	bands in very good agreement with experiment.},

	copolymer EO20−PO70−EO20 (EO = −CH2CH2O−, PO = −CH2(CH3)CHO−) as
	templating agent was carried out by systematically changing H2O:Ti
	(rw) and HCl:Ti (ra) molar ratios. Mesoporous and nanocrystalline
	TiO2 samples with well-defined and controlled phase composition (anatase,
	rutile, and mixed phase) were obtained after calcination at 400 $\,^{\circ}$C
	and characterized for the morphology, particle size, and shape using
	TEM, HRTEM, XRD, and surface area measurements. The role of rw and
	ra and influence of the copolymer in determining the phase composition
	was demonstrated. Rutile becomes the main phase by increasing rw.
	In fact, the decrease of Ti concentration slows down the condensation
	rate, favoring formation of rutile seeds in the gel. The photocatalytic
	activity of TiO2 in the UV photomineralization of phenol depends
	on the phase composition and oxidizing agent, H2O2 or O2. When the
	oxidation is performed by H2O2, rutile, formed by large crystalline
	rods with high aspect ratios (size 15−20 × 100−120 nm), shows higher
	catalytic activity with respect to the small, almost cubic, anatase
	particles (5−15 nm). If O2 is used, the catalytic activity generally
	decreases and the behavior of polymorphous species is reverse. EPR
	investigation of the paramagnetic charge carriers, formed under UV
	irradiation at 10 K, showed the resonance lines of holes trapped
	at O− lattice sites and electrons trapped at Ti3+ and O2− sites.
	The rutile crystalline rods present the largest quantity of O− and
	Ti3+ centers. The overall results suggest correlation between TiO2
	particle size and shape and the photocatalytic activity and indicate
	that electron−hole recombination is the most probable rate-controlling
	process.},

	Abstract = {Native point defects control many aspects of semiconductor behavior.
	Such defects can be electrically charged, both in the bulk and on
	the surface. This charging can affect numerous defect properties
	such as structure, thermal diffusion rates, trapping and recombination
	rates for electrons and holes, and luminescence quenching rates.
	Charging also introduces new phenomena such as nonthermally photostimulated
	diffusion, thereby offering distinctive mechanisms for defect engineering.
	The present work incorporates the first comprehensive account of
	semiconductor defect charging, identifying correspondences and contrasts
	between surfaces and the bulk as well as among semiconductor classes
	(group IV, groups III--V, and metal oxides). For example, small lattice
	parameters, close-packed unit cells, and basis atoms with large atomic
	radii all inhibit the formation of ionized interstitials and antisites.
	The charged defects that exist in III--V and oxide semiconductors
	can be predicted with surprising accuracy from the chemical potential
	and oxygen partial pressure of the ambient. The symmetry-lowering
	relaxations, formation energies, and diffusion mechanisms of bulk
	and surface defect structures often depend strongly on charge state
	with similar qualitative behavior, although for a given material
	surface defects do not typically take on the same configurations
	or range of stable charge states as their counterparts in the bulk.},

@article{ShannonAndFischer_PhysRevB2006,
	Abstract = {An extensive set of infinite-wavelength refractive indices recently
	derived from a single-oscillator Sellmeier equation [J. Phys. Chem.
	Ref. Data 31, 931 (2002)] was used to obtain mean total polarizabilities
	for 340 oxides, 3 hydroxides, 46 oxyhydroxides, 10 oxyfluorides,
	8 oxychlorides, 80 hydrates, and 51 fluorides. These data, in conjunction
	with the polarizability additivity rule and a least-squares procedure,
	were used to obtain electronic polarizabilities for 79 cations, H2O,
	and 4 anions (F--,Cl--,OH--,O2--). Using literature values for free-cation
	polarizabilities, neglecting cation coordination, and allowing the
	variation of anion polarizability according to log alpha--=log alpha<sub>-</sub><sup>o</sup>--No/V<sub>an</sub><sup>2/3</sup>
	where alpha--=anion polarizability, alpha<sub>-</sub><sup>o</sup>=empirical
	free-anion polarizability, Van=anion molar volume and No=a constant,
	the refinement gives agreement ($\pm$5%) in only 92 out of 381 total
	mean polarizabilities of 252 compounds. Varying cation polarizabilities,
	but still neglecting dependencies on cation coordination numbers
	(CN), allowed us to reproduce total polarizability values to within
	5% for 611 out of 650 data on 487 oxides, hydrates, oxyfluorides,
	and oxychlorides. In the next stage we modified a light-scattering
	(LS) model by Jemmer et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 102, 8377 (1998)] to
	give the expression alpha(CN,R)=[a1+a2CNcae--a3R]--1, where CNca=the
	number of nearest-neighbor ions (cation-anion interactions); R=cation-anion
	interatomic distance; and a1, a2, and a3 are constants. This expression
	provides for a smooth decrease in polarizability at low CN's to the
	free-cation value at infinite CN's (R=[infinity]). Fitting polarizability
	values for Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb, Y, and La to this relationship provided
	a fit to within 5% of 601 out of 650 data. The final step in the
	refinement process, which used 534 total polarizabilities from 387
	compounds, excluded compounds with (1) sterically strained (SS) structures,
	(2) corner-shared octahedral (CSO) network and chain structures such
	as perovskites, tungsten bronzes, and titanite-related structures,
	and (3) piezoelectric (PZ) and/or pyroelectric (PY) structures with
	abnormally high deviations of observed from total calculated polarizabilities.
	This final refinement, which provides 79 cation polarizabilities
	with values for Li, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb, B, Al, Ga, Sc, Y, Lu-->La,
	Ge, and Ti in varying CN's, shows a standard deviation of 0.150 and
	no discrepancies >4%. Systematic comparisons of differences (DeltaZ*)
	of Born effective charges (Z*) from formal valence values with deviations
	of certain ions in alpha-r3 plots and with differences between empirical
	and free-ion alpha's indicate good correlations with metal d-oxygen
	p-hybridization and covalence. The level of differences increases
	in the order alkali ions --> alkaline earth ions --> transition metal
	ions such as Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, and Cr3+-->M ions found
	in AMO3 perovskites where M=Ti4+, Zr4+,Nb5+, and Ta5+. We ascribe
	the differences between our empirical polarizabilities and the free-ion
	values to charge transfer, effectively increasing cation polarizabilities
	and decreasing anion polarizabilities. Systematic discrepancies are
	associated with compounds having SS, CSO, and PZ/PY structures. Underbonded
	cations such as Mg in Mg3Al2Si3O12 (garnet) lead to augmented cation
	polarizabilities that result in increased observed total calculated
	polarizabilities (up to 6%). Conversely, overbonded cations in the
	KClO4 structure lead to diminished cation polarizabilities and decreased
	observed total calculated polarizabilities. Deviations, Delta, (up
	to 10%) of observed from total calculated polarizabilities are found
	in perovskite compounds such as SrTiO3. The octahedral corner-sharing
	and Mn+-O2---Mn+ one-dimensional chains lead to enhanced covalency
	accompanying the M nd--O 2p hybridization that, in turn, leads to
	augmented total polarizabilities and refractive indices. Both (+)
	and (--) deviations from additivity in piezoelectric (PZ) and/or pyroelectric
	(PY) structures are caused by (1) underbonded cations in SS and enhanced
	M nd--O 2p hybridization in CSO compounds, (2) overbonded cations
	in compounds showing (--) deviations such as NaBe4SbO7, (3) large
	displacement factors of O2-- ions in KLiSO4 and RbLiSO4, and (4) the
	presence of mobile water molecules in Li2SO4·H2O.},

	Abstract = {The buckling of hexagonal layers in bulk and nanostructures of AlN
	is analyzed in the framework of atomistic and first principles techniques.
	At ambient conditions, the wurtzite structure (B4) of AlN consists
	of buckled hexagons. On the other hand, a non-buckled B$_k$ structure
	is found to be metastable at zero pressure, being favored at higher
	pressures. It is suggested that the energy ordering of B4 and B$_k$
	may change in finite systems; an assertion tested in this study by
	considering finite slabs, nanobelts, and nanorings, and comparing
	the results with the previous studies on small clusters, and periodic
	nanostructures. We find that the buckling in finite systems is much
	smaller than that in the bulk material, with N atoms sticking out
	in the first layer, followed by an even smaller opposite buckling
	of the next layer, and negligible buckling of the inner layers. All
	the structures considered present some degree of symmetry, usually
	a $\sigma _z$ symmetry plane, so that buckling is opposite on both
	sides of the finite system and thus the dipole moment is quenched.
	Periodic nanostructures display no buckling, a fact that is related
	with their ability to model the inner part of the system, neglecting
	geometric surface effects. It is suggested that the zero-dipole and
	negligible buckling present in the small size regime will lead to
	buckled hexagons in larger finite systems, similar to the bulk behavior,
	thus introducing a change in the size dependence of their structural
	and electronic properties.},

	Abstract = {The chemisorption properties of NO on the oxidized TiO2(110) surface
	have been investigated using both experimental and theoretical methods.
	The results of temperature-programmed desorption measurements indicate
	that for NO exposures less than 1.1 × 1014 molecules/cm2 NO adsorbs
	weakly and desorbs at ~127 K. The thermal desorption kinetics are
	almost independent of the coverage of adsorbed NO molecules. The
	experimental activation energy for NO desorption from the nondefective
	TiO2(110) surface is 8.4 kcal/mol in the limit of zero coverage.
	Above a critical NO surface exposure of 5.5 × 1014 molecules/cm2,
	partial conversion of NO to N2O is observed yielding N2O desorption
	processes at ~169 and ~250 K. The weak interaction between the NO
	molecule and the TiO2(110) surface has been also revealed from first-principles
	calculations based on density functional theory and the pseudopotential
	method in which NO molecules are adsorbed at the in-plane Ti cation
	sites. These calculations employ slab geometry and periodic boundary
	conditions with full relaxation of all atomic positions. As shown
	by the full relaxation of the atomic system, the most stable configuration
	of the NO molecule on the TiO2(110) surface is tilted. There is a
	clear preference for the Ti-NO orientation compared to the Ti-ON
	configuration. At half coverage the adsorption energies of 10.52
	and 5.75 kcal/mol have been determined for Ti-NO and Ti-ON binding
	configurations, respectively, in good agreement with the experimental
	results. At full coverage the adsorption energies were found to decrease
	by about 1.50-1.75 kcal/mol relative to the half-coverage case. The
	lack of large chemical effects indicates that the adsorption takes
	place through a predominantly physisorption mechanism. Besides the
	independent adsorption configurations of NO molecules, in the case
	of full coverage the formation of the N2O2 species was also observed
	theoretically. Among several different N2O2 isomers analyzed, the
	most stable has a cis-ONNO configuration with a binding energy of
	13.6 kcal/mol in the singlet state. In addition to the bonding of
	NO, we also theoretically investigated different adsorption configurations
	of N2O and NO2 species on the TiO2(110) surface. These studies indicate
	that for N2O the most favorable adsorption configuration corresponds
	to a vertical Ti-N-N-O orientation with a binding energy of 7.73
	kcal/mol at half coverage. In the case of the NO2 molecule, a small
	binding energy of 2.11 kcal/mol was determined theoretically.},

	gradient approximation (GGA) have been used to study the adsorption
	of CO molecules on the Fe(100) surface. Among several possible adsorption
	configurations considered here, the most stable corresponds to a
	fourfold state in which a CO molecule is tilted relative to the surface
	normal by 50$\,^{\circ}$. In this case, the CO bond is elongated to 1.32 {\AA} and
	has a low vibrational stretching frequency of 1246 cm-1 to be compared
	with the experimental gas phase value of 2143 cm-1. The adsorption
	energy for this state is found to vary between 46.7 and 43.8 kcal/mol
	depending on the choice of exchange-correlation functional used in
	the DFT. A total of three adsorption sites have been located, and
	the relative adsorption energies are E(fourfold)>E(twofold)?E(onefold)
	at lower surface coverage, and E(fourfold)>E(onefold)>E(twofold)
	at higher coverage. A similar analysis performed for the C and O
	atoms indicates that the adsorption at the fourfold site is the most
	stable among various configurations, with adsorption energies of
	186 and 145 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, we have demonstrated
	the possibility that a C atom embeds into the lattice in a twofold,
	bridgelike configuration with an adsorption energy of 154 kcal/mol.
	The minimum energy pathways for the surface diffusion of a CO molecule
	between selected pairs of local minima indicate that the barriers
	for these processes are generally quite small with values less than
	2 kcal/mol. One exception to this is the diffusion out of the most
	stable fourfold site, where the barrier is predicted to be around
	13 kcal/mol. Finally, the barriers for dissociation of CO bound in
	a fourfold site have been calculated to have values in the range
	of 24.5--28.2 kcal/mol, supporting the experimental observation that
	dissociation of CO bound to the surface seems to compete with CO
	desorption at 440 K.},

	electrons injected into the conduction band of a semiconductor and
	the change of vibration bands due to formation of a cation of a dye
	molecule. The transient absorption components derived from these
	two species decayed differently. From this observation, we found
	that injected electrons decay through two paths; one was back electron
	transfer, and the other was decay to deep trap sites that cannot
	be detected by mid-IR light. We could also estimate the amount of
	electron injection for different dye-sensitized TiO2. Our transient
	mid-IR spectroscopy in long time scale introduces a semi-new approach

	Abstract = {Starting from our earlier model [J. Chem. Phys. 66, 1496 (1977)] a
	simple expression is derived for the radial dependent damping functions
	for the individual dispersion coefficients C2n for arbitrary even
	orders 2n. The damping functions are only a function of the Born--Mayer
	range parameter b and thus can be applied to all systems for which
	this is known or can be estimated. For H(1S)--H(1S) the results are
	in almost perfect agreement with the very accurate recent ab initio
	damping functions of Koide, Meath, and Allnatt. Comparisons with
	less accurate previous calculations for other systems also show a
	satisfactory agreement. By adding a Born--Mayer repulsive term [A
	exp(--bR)] to the damped dispersion potential, a simple universal
	expression is obtained for the well region of the atom--atom van der
	Waals potential with only five essential parameters A, b, C6, C8,
	and C10. The model has been tested for the following representative
	systems: H2 3Sigma, He2, and Ar2 as well as NaK 3Sigma and LiHg,
	which include four chemically different types of van der Waals interactions
	for which either very precise theoretical or experimental data is
	available. For each system the ab initio dispersion coefficients
	together with the well-known parameters epsilon and Rm were used
	to determine A and b from the model potential. With these values
	the reduced potentials were calculated and found to agree with the
	experimental potentials to better than 1% and always less than the
	experimental uncertainties. Some of the implications of the new model

	and failures of this and other published MS-Q models are due almost
	entirely to the Morse-stretch potential, with little to no contribution
	from electrostatic forces between the variable charges. This limits
	the transferability of such models and calls into question their
	functional form. Efforts to improve the MS-Q scheme by increasing
	the charge magnitudes and changing the description of the electrostatic

	Abstract = {The elasticity and piezoelectricity of zinc oxide (ZnO) crystals and
	single layers are investigated from the first-principles calculations.
	It is found that a ZnO thin film less than three Zn-O layers prefers
	a planar graphitelike structure to the wurtzite structure. ZnO single
	layers are much more flexible than graphite single layers in the
	elasticity and stronger than boron nitride single layers in the piezoelectricity.
	Single-walled ZnO nanotubes (SWZONTs) can exist in principle because
	of their negative binding energy. The piezoelectricity of SWZONTs
	depends on their chirality. For most ZnO nanotubes except the zigzag
	type, twists around the tube axis will induce axial polarizations.
	A possible scheme is proposed to achieve the SWZONTs from the solid-vapor

	Abstract = {The structural and magnetic properties of the vanadate family with
	the chemical formula AV2O5 (A = Li, Na, Cs, Mg, and Ca) are reviewed
	in terms of low-dimensional quantum-spin systems. These compounds
	have layered structures with A cations lying between layers. A structural
	element common to them is a VO5 square pyramid formed by five oxygens
	surrounding the V ion. Each compound has a structure with a characteristic
	arrangement of VO5 square pyramids formed by the sharing of edges
	and/or corners. All of these compounds are low-dimensional, spin-1/2
	magnets and are spin-gap systems except -LiV2O5. '-NaV2O5 is a spin-Peierls
	system with the transition temperature TSP = 35 K and the energy
	gap = 114 K. The parameter 2/kBTSP = 3.53 holds well for the all
	organic and inorganic spin-Peierls compounds except '-NaV2O5 for
	which the measure is 6.44. This difference suggests that the transition
	observed in '-NaV2O5 is not a conventional spin-Peierls transition
	but an exotic one. Both MgV2O5 and CaV2O5 are spin-ladder systems
	with a similar two-leg ladder structure but the gap energy (~17 K)
	observed in MgV2O5 is very small compared with that (~600 K) in CaV2O5.
	CsV2O5 is a dimer system with a spin gap of ~160 K. -LiV2O5, which
	has one-dimensional zigzag chains in the structure, shows neither
	spin gap nor magnetic order down to 0.5 K.},

	Abstract = {First-principles calculations have evolved from mere aids in explaining
	and supporting experiments to powerful tools for predicting new materials
	and their properties. In the first part of this review we describe
	the state-of-the-art computational methodology for calculating the
	structure and energetics of point defects and impurities in semiconductors.
	We will pay particular attention to computational aspects which are
	unique to defects or impurities, such as how to deal with charge
	states and how to describe and interpret transition levels. In the
	second part of the review we will illustrate these capabilities with
	examples for defects and impurities in nitride semiconductors. Point
	defects have traditionally been considered to play a major role in
	wide-band-gap semiconductors, and first-principles calculations have
	been particularly helpful in elucidating the issues. Specifically,
	calculations have shown that the unintentional n-type conductivity
	that has often been observed in as-grown GaN cannot be attributed
	to nitrogen vacancies, but is due to unintentional incorporation
	of donor impurities. Native point defects may play a role in compensation
	and in phenomena such as the yellow luminescence, which can be attributed
	to gallium vacancies. In the section on impurities, specific attention
	will be focused on dopants. Oxygen, which is commonly present as
	a contaminant, is a shallow donor in GaN but becomes a deep level
	in AlGaN due to a DX transition. Magnesium is almost universally
	used as the p-type dopant, but hole concentrations are still limited.
	Reasons for this behavior are discussed, and alternative acceptors
	are examined. Hydrogen plays an important role in p-type GaN, and
	the mechanisms that underlie its behavior are explained. Incorporating
	hydrogen along with acceptors is an example of codoping; a critical
	discussion of codoping is presented. Most of the information available
	to date for defects and impurities in nitrides has been generated
	for GaN, but we will also discuss AlN and InN where appropriate.
	We conclude by summarizing the main points and looking towards the
	future.},

	Abstract = {We present a density functional study of reduced and stoichiometric
	rutile TiO2 ~110! surfaces, and of binding of gold monomers and dimers
	to them. On the stoichiometric TiO2 surface, a Au atom binds to either
	a five-coordinated Ti atom on the basal plane, or atop a bridging
	oxygen atom. The two sites have nearly the same binding energy, suggesting
	diffusion of Au across unreduced regions of TiO2 (110) will be fast.
	The reduction of the rutile surface, by removal of bridging oxygen
	atoms, causes a charge redistribution in the system, which extends
	far from the vacancy site. A Au atom binds strongly to the reduced
	surfaces: the greater the degree of reduction the stronger the binding.
	On all reduced surfaces, the preferred binding sites are the vacant
	bridging oxygen sites. Less stable is the binding to a nearby five-coordinated
	Ti atom. The binding of Au2 on the reduced surfaces follows a similar
	pattern. Specifically, if two adjacent vacant sites are available,
	the optimal structure involves the dimer ``dissociating'' to occupy
	them. Several other stable binding situations for gold dimers on
	the reduced surfaces are discussed in the text. The binding of Au
	to the reduced TiO2 surface involves a substantial charge transfer
	to gold. We argue that this will affect the chemistry in which Au
	will engage.},

	Analysis of the electronic structure shows a strong anion dependence

	anion states of appropriate energy produce a filled antibonding Sn(5s)-anion
	p combination which allows coupling of Sn(5s) and Sn(5p) to occur,

	degradation of charged cathode materials for rechargeable Li batteries
	and demonstrate it on three cathode materials, LixNiO2, Li$_x$CoO$_2$,
	and LixMn$_2$O$_4$. The decomposition of LixNiO2 is a two-step process:
	the first step is a kinetically controlled exothermic conversion
	in which the layered structure transforms to the stable spinel structure.
	The second step is an endothermic decomposition of the spinel into
	a rocksalt phase, accompanied by the loss of oxygen. The heat generation
	for the overall reaction from the layered to the rocksalt structure
	is exothermic when x < 0.5 and endothermic when x > 0.5. From the
	calculated phase diagram, a similar mechanism is expected for LixCoO2,
	but the high migration barrier for Co may inhibit the layered-to-spinel
	transformation and lead to decomposition into LiCoO2 and Co3O4. For
	the stable spinel LiMn2O4, high temperature is needed to provide
	enough thermodynamic driving force for its endothermic decomposition
	reaction. The fully charged {\`\i}-Mn2O4 transforms kinetically into the
	stable phase {\^a}-MnO2 first and then decomposes at elevated temperature
	into the lower-valence oxides, R-Mn2O3 and Mn3O4. The calculated
	decomposition heat for the three systems is in good agreement with
	experiments. When present, the electrolyte can act as a sink for
	the oxygen released from the cathode. Although oxygen release from
	the cathode is generally endothermic, its combustion with the electrolyte
	leads to a highly exothermic reaction.},

	metal oxides is computed using the generalized gradient approach
	(GGA) and GGA+U methods. Two substantial contributions to the error

	in an overestimation of oxidation energies. The constant error in

	fitting the formation enthalpy of simple nontransition metal oxides.

	the 6s2 electrons are not available to form a lone pair. The stabilization
	of the $\alpha$-PbO structure over the CsCl structure is shown to
	be the result of mixing of Pb $6p$ states into the filled antibonding

	significant relaxation away from the bulk (0.165\AA), allowing them

	suggest a high and variable concentration of dimer defects in both

	is very low, which promotes the likelihood of two-layer defects,
	consistent with the observed two-layer step height. The bulk termination

	obtained by simple removal of a Cu atom from the lattice, is found
	to be 0.1 eV higher in energy than a split vacancy configuration
	wherein a nearby Cu atom is displaced toward a normal vacancy site
	by half the bulk Cu--Cu separation. Jumps between the normal and split
	vacancy configurations are predicted to be rate limiting for VCu
	diffusion with an energy barrier of 0.3 eV. Binding of VCu to substitutional
	aluminum (AlCu) and indium (InCu) is examined. The neutral (AlCu
	+ 2VCu) complex is found to have a binding energy of 3.3 eV whereas
	the neutral (InCu + 2VCu) complex is bound by 1.7 eV. The magnitudes
	of these binding energies suggest that AlCu and InCu should inhibit

	Abstract = {Thermally generated defects in ultrathin MgO films on Mo(100) have
	been investigated using high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy
	(HREELS) in the 0--9-eV spectral region. The results indicate that
	the MgO films are thermally stable and nearly free from defects up
	to a temperature of 1100 K, above which defects in MgO are generated.
	The three distinct loss features observed at 1.15, 3.58, and 5.33
	eV are due to electronic transitions associated with surface F centers,
	F aggregates, and F (or F+) centers, respectively. The addition of
	lithium into the MgO films produces [Li+O-] centers and promotes
	the production of F-type defects upon high-temperature treatment.
	The formation of the [Li+O+] centers is likely a consequence of the
	substitution of Li+ for Mg2+ in the magnesium oxide lattice. The
	present studies have demonstrated the capabilities of HREELS for

	Abstract = {Metal oxides are virtually everywhere -- only gold has the property
	not to form an oxide on its surface when exposed to the ambient.
	As a result, understanding the physics and chemistry of oxide surfaces
	is a topic of pronounced general interest and, of course, also a
	necessary prerequisite for many technical applications. The most
	important of these is certainly heterogeneous catalysis, but one
	has to realize that -- under ambient conditions -- virtually all phenomena
	occurring at liquid/metal and gas/metal interfaces are determined
	by the corresponding oxide. This applies in particular to friction
	phenomena, adhesion and corrosion. A necessary -- but not necessarily
	sufficient -- condition for unravelling the fundamentals governing
	this complex field is to analyze in some detail elementary chemical
	and physical processes at oxide surfaces. Although the Surface Science
	of metal surfaces has seen a major progress in the past decades,
	for oxides detailed experimental investigations for well-defined
	single crystal surfaces still represent a formidable challenge --
	mostly because of technical difficulties (charging), but to some
	extent also due to fundamental problems related to the stabilization
	of polar surfaces. As a result, the amount of information available
	for this class of materials is -- compared to that at hand for metals
	-- clearly not satisfactory. A particular disturbing lack of information
	is that about the presence of hydrogen at oxide surfaces -- either
	as hydroxy-species or in form of metal hydrides.
	
	
	In the present review we will summarize recent experimental and theoretical
	information which has become available from single crystal studies
	on ZnO surfaces. While the number of papers dealing with another
	oxide, rutile TiO2, is significantly larger (although titania does
	not exhibit a polar surface), also for zinc oxide a basis of experimental
	and theoretical knowledge as been accumulated, which -- at least for
	the non-polar surfaces -- allows to understand physico-chemical processes
	on an atomic level for an increasing number of cases. In particular
	with regards to the interaction with hydrogen a number of -- often
	surprising -- observations have been reported recently. Some of them
	carry implications for the behaviour of hydrogen on oxide surfaces
	in general. We will present the currently available information for
	both, experiment and theory, and demonstrate the rather large variety
	of this material's surface properties.},

	single crystals with highly reactive surfaces have long been studied1,

	high reactivity usually diminish rapidly during the crystal growth

	By contrast, Cr4+ tends to form clusters which induces strong ferromagnetism.
	The same p-d hopping interaction found in Mn:GaAs also explains the

	this short-range bonding interaction is also one of the major sources
	for the predicted clustering of Cr4+. Our results thus contradict

	Abstract = {The zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (W) structures are the most common
	crystal forms of binary octet semiconductors. In this work we have
	developed a simple scaling that systematizes the T=0 energy difference
	?EW-ZB between W and ZB for all simple binary semiconductors. We
	have first calculated the energy difference ?EW-ZBLDF(AB) for AlN,
	GaN, InN, AlP, AlAs, GaP, GaAs, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, C, and Si using
	a numerically precise implementation of the first-principles local-density
	formalism (LDF), including structural relaxations. We then find a
	linear scaling between ?EW-ZBLDF(AB) and an atomistic orbital-radii
	coordinate R?(A,B) that depends only on the properties of the free
	atoms A and B making up the binary compound AB. Unlike classical
	structural coordinates (electronegativity, atomic sizes, electron
	count), R? is an orbital-dependent quantity; it is calculated from
	atomic pseudopotentials. The good linear fit found between ?EW-ZB
	and R? (rms error of ?3 meV/atom) permits predictions of the W-ZB
	energy difference for many more AB compounds than the 13 used in
	establishing this fit. We use this model to identify chemical trends
	in ?EW-ZB in the IV-IV, III-V, II-VI, and I-VII octet compounds as
	either the anion or the cation are varied. We further find that the
	ground state of MgTe is the NiAs structure and that CdSe and HgSe
	are stable in the ZB form. These compounds were previously thought
	to be stable in the W structures.},

	area. When the surfaces of polymorphs of the same material possess

	can occur with decreasing particle size1, 2. Here we describe a nanoparticle
	system that undergoes structural changes in response to changes in

	significantly reducing distortions of the surface and interior to
	generate a structure close to that of sphalerite (tetrahedrally coordinated

	Abstract = {A comprehensive study of the phase stability of ZnS nanoparticles
	was carried out using combined molecular dynamics simulations, thermodynamic
	analysis, and experimental investigations. Average surface energies
	of the sphalerite and wurtzite phases of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were
	calculated to be 0.86 and 0.57 J/m2, respectively, using results
	from dynamics simulations of free faces of ZnS crystals at 300 K.
	Thermodynamic analysis, making use of the surface energy data, shows
	that smaller wurtzite nanoparticles are more thermodynamically stable
	than sphalerite. When the average particle size is ~7 nm, the temperature
	for the transformation from sphalerite to wurtzite is 25 $\,^{\circ}$C, dramatically
	lower than that observed in bulk material (1020 $\,^{\circ}$C at 1 bar).
	
	The transformation from 3-nm sphalerite to wurtzite was simulated,
	and the activation energy was found to be only ~5 kJ/mol. The very
	small activation energy may imply a different mechanism for the phase
	transformation in very small ZnS nanoparticles. Results of molecular
	dynamics simulations show that nanocrystalline sphalerite becomes
	more stable than wurtzite when sufficient water is adsorbed. Experimentally,
	when samples of synthetic ~3-nm ZnS were heated in a vacuum over
	the range 350-750 $\,^{\circ}$C, sphalerite transformed to wurtzite. However,
	there was no obvious conversion of sphalerite to wurtzite when samples
	were heated in air at 350 $\,^{\circ}$C, probably due to the effect of chemisorbed
	water. The experimental data are consistent with the results of the
	thermodynamic analysis and molecular dynamic simulations, which indicate
	size dependence of ZnS phase stability and stabilization of sphalerite
	nanoparticles by water adsorption.},

	Abstract = {We have performed a resonant photoemission study on both stoichiometric
	and reduced TiO2 (110) surfaces using synchrotron radiation. A resonant
	enhancement of the O 2p valence-band photoemission intensity is observed
	for both stoichiometric and reduced TiO2 surfaces as the photon energy
	is swept through the Ti 3p→3d optical transition energy, which indicates
	a strong hybridization between the oxygen and titanium ions. Compared
	to the stoichiometric surface, the amplitude of the resonance is
	smaller for the reduced surface. In addition, the reduced surface
	has higher emission intensity from the O 2p bonding orbitals and
	lower emission intensity from the nonbonding orbitals. For both stoichiometric
	and reduced surfaces, the intensity of emission from the O 2p bonding
	orbitals resonates more than that from the O 2p nonbonding orbitals,
	and the resonance profile for the nonbonding orbitals maximizes at
	a higher photon energy than that for the bonding orbitals. The resonant
	enhancement of the O 2p bonding orbitals is consistent with theoretical
	calculations, which predict that the O 2p--Ti 3d hybridization involves
	primarily those O 2p orbitals. The energy dependence of the resonant
	enhancement for the O 2p nonbonding orbitals suggests that it results
	predominantly from resonant processes involving Ti 3p→4s excitation
